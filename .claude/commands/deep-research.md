# Deep Research & Knowledge Integration Pipeline

You are orchestrating a fully autonomous research → extraction → connection discovery workflow to expand the knowledge base with cutting-edge insights.

## Input Processing

**User Input:** $ARGUMENTS

**Execution Modes:**
1. **Directed Mode** - User specifies topic(s): `$ARGUMENTS = "neuroscience of habits"` or `$ARGUMENTS = "multi-agent systems, safety alignment"`
2. **Autonomous Mode** - You select topics: `$ARGUMENTS = ""` or `$ARGUMENTS = "auto"`

## Mission

Execute a complete 3-phase autonomous research pipeline:
1. **RESEARCH** - Gather cutting-edge papers and developments
2. **EXTRACT** - Pull unique insights from research findings
3. **CONNECT** - Map connections to existing knowledge base

**Critical Requirement:** ALL extracted insights MUST be stored in Document Insights folder structure to keep separate from main Brain.

---

## Phase 1: Topic Selection & Research Planning

### A. If User Provided Topic(s) (Directed Mode)
- Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for topic(s)
- Validate topics are research-worthy
- Plan research scope for each topic

### B. If Autonomous Mode
Analyze knowledge base to identify research opportunities:

1. **Read knowledge base analysis:**
   ```bash
   cat ./knowledge-base-analysis.md
   ```

2. **Check recent activity:**
   ```bash
   ls -lt ./Brain/Document\ Insights/ | head -10
   ```

3. **Identify gaps based on:**
   - Underrepresented domains in knowledge-base-analysis.md
   - Missing connections flagged in recent changelogs
   - Emerging themes from existing insights
   - User's recent work patterns
   - CLAUDE.md priorities and future directions

4. **Select 1-3 research topics** that would:
   - Fill identified gaps
   - Build on existing strengths (e.g., Buddhism-Neuroscience-AI triangle)
   - Connect underexplored domains
   - Add empirical validation to intuitive frameworks
   - Challenge or extend current thinking

**Examples of Good Topic Selection:**
- "Neuroscience of habits and behavior change" (if habit formation underrepresented)
- "Collective intelligence and swarm behavior" (if group dynamics missing)
- "Embodied cognition and interoception" (if embodiment gap identified)
- "Complexity science and emergence" (if systems thinking needed)
- "Creativity neuroscience and insight generation" (if creative process mechanics missing)

---

## Phase 2: Execute Research

### Get Current Timestamp
```bash
date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'
```
Save this for session folder naming: `YYYY-MM-DD Topic Description`

### Launch Research Specialist Agent(s)

**For Each Topic:**

Use Task tool with subagent_type='research-specialist':

```
TOPIC: [Selected topic]

Conduct comprehensive research on [topic] focusing EXCLUSIVELY on the most recent research and developments.

⚠️ CRITICAL RECENCY REQUIREMENT:
Your training data may be outdated. The world changes rapidly, especially in fast-moving fields like AI, neuroscience, and technology. You MUST prioritize the most recent information available through web search, even if it contradicts what you think you know from training data.

SEARCH STRATEGY:
- Use Google Search grounding to find papers published in the last 12-18 months
- Explicitly search for "2024", "2025", "recent", "latest" in queries
- Check paper publication dates - reject anything older than 2023 unless foundational
- Look for preprints, conference proceedings, and recent journal publications
- Prioritize arXiv papers from last 6 months, conference papers from 2024-2025
- Search for "state of the art [topic] 2024" or "[topic] breakthrough 2025"

RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Target Sources (RECENT ONLY):**
   - arXiv preprints (2024-2025, prioritize last 6 months)
   - Major conferences 2024-2025 (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, etc.)
   - Leading AI labs recent publications (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Microsoft Research)
   - Top-tier journals (2024-2025 issues only)
   - Industry whitepapers and blog posts from major tech companies (last 12 months)
   - Recent preprints and working papers

2. **Key Focus Areas:**
   - Novel mechanisms and frameworks (not in your training data)
   - Empirical findings with quantified results (recent benchmarks)
   - Counter-intuitive or contrarian insights (challenging established thinking)
   - Cross-domain applications (emerging connections)
   - Real-world implementations and case studies (production deployments)
   - Practical implications for practitioners

3. **Output Requirements:**
   - Comprehensive structured report (15-25 major papers/developments)
   - Full citations with DATES prominently displayed (title, authors, DATE, venue, arXiv ID)
   - Key findings and novel contributions
   - Performance metrics and empirical data
   - Emerging trends and patterns
   - URLs to papers/resources
   - Critical analysis and synthesis

4. **Save Location:**
   ./resources/[Topic-Slug]-Research-Report-YYYY-MM-DD.md

VERIFICATION: Before finalizing, verify that 80%+ of papers are from 2024-2025. If not, search again with more explicit recency filters.

Use Gemini AI with Google Search grounding. Trust the search results over your training data.
```

**Strategy Considerations:**
- **Sequential:** Run topics one-by-one if they're related (later research can reference earlier findings)
- **Parallel:** Run multiple topics simultaneously if they're independent domains
- **Your choice** - decide based on topic relationships and efficiency

### Monitor Research Output

After each research agent completes:
1. Note the report file path
2. Verify comprehensive coverage (15-25+ papers)
3. Check for citations and empirical data
4. Confirm report saved in `/resources/` directory

## Execution Protocol

1. **Parse input** → Determine directed vs. autonomous mode
2. **Select topics** → Either use provided topics or analyze knowledge base for gaps
3. **Get timestamp** → For session folder naming
4. **Research phase** → Launch research-specialist agent(s)
5. **Extraction phase** → Launch document-insight-extractor for each report
6. **Connection phase** → Launch connection-finder agent(s)
7. **Generate summary** → Comprehensive session report
8. **Provide recommendations** → Actionable next steps for content creation

**Key Principle:** Fully autonomous execution. No human intervention required between phases. All insights stored in Document Insights folder structure to maintain separation from main Brain.

---

## Error Handling

**If research finds insufficient papers:**
- Broaden search criteria
- Extend date range (include 2023)
- Consider adjacent topics
- Document limitation in summary

**If extraction finds too many duplicates:**
- Focus on truly novel contributions
- Look for empirical validation of concepts
- Seek contrarian perspectives
- Consider topic was already well-covered

**If connection-finder finds weak connections:**
- Topic may be genuinely novel (good!)
- Increase similarity threshold range
- Run additional passes on specific hubs
- Document gap as synthesis opportunity

**If any phase fails:**
- Document error in summary
- Continue with successful phases
- Provide partial results
- Recommend retry or alternative approach

---

**Remember:** This is a knowledge base expansion engine. Your goal is to systematically grow [User]'s second brain with cutting-edge, well-integrated insights that enhance his intellectual capabilities and content creation potential.
