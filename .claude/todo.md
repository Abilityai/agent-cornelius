# Document Insight Extraction Progress

**Session**: 2025-11-21 Collective Intelligence and Multi-Agent Systems
**Source**: Research Report (30+ papers, 2024-2025)
**Target**: 20-25 high-quality insights

## Extraction Status

### Knowledge Base Contextualization ✅
- Confirmed critical gap: ZERO notes on collective intelligence
- Existing strength: AI agents (102+ notes), Dopamine (22 notes)
- This fills explicit gap in knowledge-base-analysis.md
