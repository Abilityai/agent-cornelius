**Key Framework:**
- **Energy allostasis:** Brain's predictive regulation of metabolic needs
- Disruptions contribute to bidirectional relationship between **depression and metabolic dysfunction**
- Disruptions can originate from:
  - **Metabolic signals** (faulty sensory input → faulty prediction errors)
  - **Neural interoceptive changes** (faulty predictions of energetic needs)
  - **Interaction between the two**

**Clinical Implications:** Explains why metabolic disorders increase depression risk and vice versa - shared interoceptive dysfunction.

**Review:** "Interoception in anxiety, depression, and psychosis: a review"
**Published:** eClinicalMedicine (Lancet), **2024**
**Also:** PMC - https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11169962/
**URL:** https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00252-9/fulltext

**Key Findings:**

**Cardiac Interoceptive Accuracy:**
- Meta-analysis of 40 studies (N = 2130): **No overall effect** of trait anxiety on heartbeat perception (r = 0.03)
- Heartbeat perception **not systematically impaired** in anxiety or depression
- However: Cardiac interoceptive **processing flexibility** is reduced in depression/anxiety

**Study:** "Transdiagnostic failure to adapt interoceptive precision estimates across affective, substance use, and eating disorders"
**Published:** **2024**
**URL:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38823571/

**Key Finding (2025):** During interoceptive perturbation (breath-holding):
- **Healthy individuals:** Increased precision-weighting assigned to cardiac signals
- **Patients (anxiety/depression/substance use/eating disorders):** **Did not adapt precision**
- **Implication:** Unable to adjust beliefs about cardiac signal precision → prevents accurate perception of cardiac changes

**Study:** "Perceptual insensitivity to the modulation of interoceptive signals in depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders"
**Published:** Scientific Reports, **2021** (still cited heavily in 2024-2025)
**URL:** https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81307-3
**Also:** PMC - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7822872/

**Key Finding:** Healthy participants showed performance improvements across three heartbeat perception conditions; patients with depression/anxiety/substance use showed **minimal improvement**. Cardiac interoceptive processing less flexible in clinical populations.

**Important Caveat:** Lack of association with cardiac interoceptive accuracy doesn't rule out interoceptive dysfunction in other domains (e.g., **respiration, gastrointestinal signals**).

**Review:** "Cross-cultural differences in somatic awareness and interoceptive accuracy: a review of the literature and directions for future research"
**Published:** Frontiers in Psychology, **2014** (foundational, still heavily cited in 2024-2025)
**URL:** https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01379/full
**Also:** PMC - https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4253951/
**PubMed:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25520688/

**The Paradox:**
- Non-Western cultures exhibit **heightened somatic focus and awareness** across various contexts
- Yet also exhibit **less interoceptive accuracy** in laboratory studies

**West African vs. European American Findings:**
- West Africans: **Higher interoceptive awareness**, **lower interoceptive accuracy**
- West African cultural contexts foster **higher attention to bodily signals**
- European Americans: Lower awareness, higher accuracy

**Asian Populations:**
- Consistently demonstrated **less interoceptive accuracy**
- More likely to **misattribute causes** of bodily changes
- Greater discrepancies between **perceived and actual bodily states**
