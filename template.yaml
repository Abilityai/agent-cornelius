# Short tagline for dashboard cards
tagline: "Second brain partner and insight harvester"

# Detailed description
description: |
  Manages an Obsidian second brain knowledge base. Provides insight extraction,
  connection discovery, perspective synthesis, and article generation from
  the knowledge base. Specializes in cross-domain synthesis across Buddhism,
  neuroscience, AI, decision-making, and business psychology.

# Example use cases - what you can ask this agent
use_cases:
  - "What's Eugene's unique perspective on [topic]?"
  - "Create an article about [subject] using permanent notes"
  - "Find connections between [concept A] and [concept B]"
  - "Generate a 30-second video script about [topic]"
  - "What insights exist about AI agent architecture?"
  - "Synthesize perspectives on dopamine and decision-making"
  - "Extract key insights from recent notes"
  - "Map connections across Buddhism and neuroscience"
