## Core Insight

Organizations with AI strategy dropped from 59% (2020) to 39% (2024) - a 20 percentage point decline - while AI adoption soared from 55% (2023) to 78% (2024). Strategic clarity is inversely correlated with adoption. Organizations are adopting AI faster than they can think about it strategically.

## Context & Evidence

**The inverse correlation**:
- AI adoption: 55% → 78% (23 points UP)
- Strategic clarity: 59% → 39% (20 points DOWN)

**What this reveals**:

**Tactical proliferation without strategic direction**:
- FOMO-driven adoption ("everyone's doing AI")
- Board pressure to "have an AI strategy"
- Marketing hype overwhelming strategic thinking
- Pilot purgatory: launching experiments without framework

**Leadership gap widening**:
- Only 44% of CEOs believe their CIOs are AI-savvy enough
- Only 40% see their CDOs as AI savvy
- 61% of organizations have no internal AI use guidelines
- Only 1% view their GenAI strategies as "mature"

**The mechanism**:
1. Pressure to adopt AI intensifies (competition, hype, board)
2. Organizations launch initiatives without strategy
3. Proliferation of uncoordinated pilots
4. Resource fragmentation across experiments
5. Strategic confusion increases as tactical complexity grows
6. Abandonment follows (42% in 2025)

**Quote from expert** (Sreekanth Menon, Genpact):
"About half of executives are framing gen AI solely as a productivity tool - this is myopic vision... the infancy of gen AI, combined with a warped conception of its potential, has led to reluctant budgetary spending."

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI project abandonment jumped 147% in one year - acceleration of failure]] - Strategic confusion leads to abandonment acceleration
- [[84% of AI failures are leadership-driven not technical]] - Declining strategic clarity is leadership failure manifesting
- [[Less than 20% track GenAI KPIs yet tracking has most impact on results]] - Can't define KPIs without strategy
- [[GenAI has 2x higher failure rate than traditional AI - The GenAI Divide]] - "Infinite possibilities" of GenAI requires more strategy, not less

**Novel pattern**: Technology hype can destroy strategic thinking capacity. More adoption → Less clarity is counterintuitive but empirically validated.
