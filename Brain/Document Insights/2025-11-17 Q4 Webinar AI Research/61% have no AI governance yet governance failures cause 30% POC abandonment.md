## Core Insight

61% of organizations have no internal guidelines for AI use (Deloitte), yet Gartner cites "poor data quality, inadequate risk controls" as the primary reason 30% of GenAI POCs will be abandoned by end of 2025. Organizations are skipping the governance foundation, then abandoning projects when governance failures inevitably occur. The lack of governance isn't preventing work - it's ensuring eventual failure.

## Context & Evidence

**The governance gap**:
- 61% have no internal AI use guidelines (Deloitte 2024)
- 30% of GenAI projects will be abandoned due to governance failures (Gartner)
- "Data responsibility not adopted at enterprise level"
- "No one responsible for data at the enterprise level"

**What "no governance" means in practice**:
1. **No data quality standards** → Models trained on flawed data
2. **No risk controls** → Compliance violations, security breaches
3. **No usage guidelines** → Inconsistent/inappropriate AI deployment
4. **No ownership structure** → No accountability when things fail
5. **No ethical frameworks** → Brand reputation risks

**Gartner's abandonment triggers** (all governance-related):
- Poor data quality (could be prevented by data governance)
- Inadequate risk controls (could be prevented by risk governance)
- Escalating costs (could be managed by financial governance)
- Unclear business value (could be addressed by strategic governance)

**The sequence**:
1. Launch AI initiative without governance
2. Initial progress on POC (governance issues not immediately visible)
3. Attempt to scale
4. Governance failures manifest (data quality, risk, compliance)
5. Project abandoned
6. Lesson not learned → next initiative also lacks governance

**Regulation as forcing function**:
- Deloitte: Regulation and risk now #1 barrier (increased 10 points Q1 to Q4 2024)
- 36% cite regulatory compliance as top global barrier
- External pressure (regulation) forcing internal governance organizations should have built proactively

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[IBM Watson trained on hypothetical cases not real patients - 4B dollar lesson]] - Data quality governance failure cost IBM $4B
- [[84% of AI failures are leadership-driven not technical]] - Not establishing governance is leadership failure
- [[Pilot purgatory - organizations celebrate experimentation but cannot commit to production]] - Can't scale without governance; governance gap keeps orgs in pilot mode
- [[Less than 20% track GenAI KPIs yet tracking has most impact on results]] - KPI tracking requires governance framework

**Novel insight**: Governance isn't bureaucratic overhead slowing innovation - it's the foundation that enables scaling. The "move fast and break things" ethos breaks AI projects.

**The irony**: Organizations skip governance to "move faster," then abandon 30% of projects due to governance failures. Governance would have accelerated success.
