## Core Insight

Integrated "super-platforms" (Salesforce, Microsoft, ServiceNow) are winning agentic AI deployment because they solve the #1 barrier: integration. By living natively with the data in existing CRM/ITSM systems, they bypass 90% of custom integration work, security reviews, and data-mapping that constitute the hidden cost iceberg. The primary competitive advantage is data access, not model capability.

## Context & Evidence

**Why Integration is the Barrier:**
- Custom agents must connect to every data source
- Each connection requires custom API work
- Security reviews for each data pathway
- Data mapping and transformation logic
- Months of expensive engineering work
- Brittle connections that break with system updates

**How Super-Platforms Bypass This:**
- Agent lives inside the CRM/ITSM where data already exists
- Inherits existing security model and permissions
- Uses native data structures (no mapping needed)
- Automatic updates maintain compatibility
- Deployment in 4-6 weeks vs 6-9+ months

**The Platform Winners:**
- **Salesforce Agentforce**: Native CRM data access, customer service leaders
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio**: Native M365 data, enterprise workflow automation
- **ServiceNow AI Agents**: Native ITSM data, internal operations dominance

**Production Evidence:**
- Salesforce internal: 83% autonomous resolution in 4-6 weeks
- OpenTable: 73% resolution in 3 weeks
- ServiceNow: $5.5M savings from native integration

**The Strategic Implication:**
The "moat" in agentic AI is not proprietary models or algorithms - it's privileged access to customer data within systems of record. Platforms that already own the data own the agent market for that domain.

**The Walled Garden Trade-off:**
Platform agents primarily operate within their ecosystem, less flexible for cross-enterprise workflows. But for 80% of use cases, single-platform coverage is sufficient.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Context = Perspective + Information]] - Platforms have privileged context through data access
- [[The Folder Paradigm - Agents own directories as memory]] - Platform data becomes agent memory
- [[All memory ultimately becomes text in context window]] - Native data easier to load into context
