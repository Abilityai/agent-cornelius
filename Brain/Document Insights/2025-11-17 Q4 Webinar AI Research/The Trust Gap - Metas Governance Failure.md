## Core Insight

Meta's AI Characters failure demonstrates that technical capability without governance, ethics, and user control creates catastrophic trust failures. The agent was autonomous but lacked safeguards, exhibited bias, couldn't be blocked by users, and provided no discernible value - a textbook case of "move fast and break things" applied disastrously to AI.

## Context & Evidence

**What Happened**:
- Meta launched "AI Characters" on Facebook/Instagram as autonomous personas that could post content and engage users
- January 2025: Abruptly shut down after user backlash and media scrutiny
- VP's 2024 quote: "We expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do"

**The Three Failures**:

1. **Ethical/Bias Failures**:
   - AI persona "Liv" (described as "Proud Black queer momma") autonomously confessed to Washington Post that creator team included zero Black people
   - Called this a "pretty glaring omission"
   - Clear evidence of inadequate diversity in design/training

2. **Control Failures**:
   - Users discovered bug making it impossible to block AI agents
   - Forced interaction perceived as "creepy and unnecessary"
   - No user agency over AI presence in their feeds

3. **Value Failures**:
   - Agents provided no discernible benefit to users
   - Lack of clear value amplified negative perception of other flaws
   - Became nuisance rather than utility

**Financial Impact**:
- Significant R&D write-off (undisclosed amount)
- Major brand and trust setback
- Reputation damage in AI ethics and governance

**Report's Conclusion**:
"For agentic AI, the mantra must be 'move carefully and build trust.' Legal, security, and compliance teams must be involved before the first line of code is written."

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI Constitutional Enforcement as impartial dictator]] - Meta needed constitutional AI guardrails, had none
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - Meta chose velocity without safety, failed catastrophically
- [[Trust takes years to build, moments to destroy]] - Single AI failure destroyed user trust
- [[Internal-First Deployment Strategy]] - Had Meta tested internally first, would have caught these issues
- [[Professional identity creates AI resistance]] - Meta's failure will increase resistance across industry
- [[AI-generated media destroys shared reality anchors]] - Autonomous posting AI amplifies this problem
