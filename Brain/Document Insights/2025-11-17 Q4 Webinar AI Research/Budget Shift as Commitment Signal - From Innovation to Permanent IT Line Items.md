## Core Insight

The shift from "innovation budgets" to permanent IT line items is the clearest signal distinguishing serious GenAI deployment from perpetual experimentation. In 2023, 80% of GenAI spend came from innovation budgets and one-time funding pools. By 2024, less than 25% came from innovation budgets, with 40% now having permanent allocations. This budget migration signals commitment to production deployment versus experimentation theater.

## Context & Evidence

**The Budget Evolution:**
- **2023**: 80-90% of GenAI spend from "innovation" budgets and one-time funding
- **2024**: Less than 25% from innovation budgets, 40% now permanent IT allocations
- **2025 projection**: 71% of CIOs expect GenAI budget increases over 25%, with 41% expecting increases over 50%

**Why This Matters:**
Innovation budgets are temporary, discretionary, and signal experimental status. Permanent IT line items indicate:
1. Commitment to ongoing operations
2. Executive confidence in ROI
3. Integration into core business processes
4. Sustainable funding for maintenance and scaling
5. Shift from "project" to "infrastructure" mindset

**The Paradox:**
- 60% of GenAI projects still funded from innovation budgets (stuck in experimental mode)
- Winners move successful use cases to permanent budgets early
- Budget source predicts success better than technology choice

**Spending Scale:**
- Enterprise GenAI spending: $600M (2023) → $4.6B (2024) - 8x increase
- Average enterprise spend: $7M (2023), planning 2-5x increase in 2024
- Most CIOs dedicate at least 10% of annual IT budget to GenAI

**Expert Insight:**
> "While much of 2023's enterprise GenAI spend came from 'innovation' budgets and one-time funding pools, in 2024 many leaders shifted to allocating spend to more permanent software line items." - Andreessen Horowitz, April 2024

This shift distinguishes companies moving from experiments to execution.

## Context & Evidence

**Contrarian Angle:**
Budget source is a better predictor of GenAI success than technical sophistication, team size, or even use case selection. Organizations can have the best technology and worst outcomes if funding remains experimental.

**The Signal vs. Noise:**
- **Strong signal of commitment**: Permanent IT budget allocation
- **Weak signal**: Number of pilots, amount of experimentation spend
- **Noise**: Press releases, AI strategy documents, executive enthusiasm

**Organizational Psychology:**
When something moves to permanent IT budgets, it triggers:
- Different procurement processes (more rigorous)
- Different accountability standards (ongoing ROI required)
- Different organizational politics (fewer pet projects)
- Different expectations (production-grade, not experimental)

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Budget allocation reflects psychological commitment more than technical readiness
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - Permanent budgets create accountability that forces velocity
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Permanent budgets fund production builders, innovation budgets fund experimenters
- Related to broader pattern of commitment devices and organizational signaling
