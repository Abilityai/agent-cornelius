## Core Insight

The percentage of companies scrapping AI initiatives jumped from 17% in 2024 to 42% in 2025 - a 2.5x increase that signals a crisis, not a trend. The root cause: most companies "try to jam probabilistic AI into deterministic, rule-bound systems... Neither works." Success requires hybrid architectures that integrate with (not replace) core compliance systems.

## Context & Evidence

**The abandonment crisis:**
- **42%** of companies scrapped most AI initiatives in 2025
- Up from **17%** in 2024
- 2.5x increase year-over-year
- "That's not a trend; it's a crisis"

**Why initiatives are failing:**
- Companies trying to force "probabilistic AI into deterministic, rule-bound systems"
- Compliance systems are deterministic (must follow exact rules)
- AI is probabilistic (gives likely answers, not certain ones)
- "Rip and replace" moonshots fail because incompatible architectures

**The rejection pattern CEOs apply:**
- "This is too much, too fast"
- "It's not compatible with our core, rule-bound compliance systems"
- "The only viable path is a hybrid architecture"
- "Come back with a plan for integration, not replacement"

**The solution - hybrid architectures:**
- Keep deterministic core for compliance-critical functions
- Add probabilistic AI layer for judgment-intensive tasks
- Integration strategy, not replacement strategy
- Allows AI benefits while maintaining regulatory compliance
- Gradual rollout, not big-bang transformation

**Why this matters for 2025 investment decisions:**
- CEOs now reject proposals that don't address integration complexity
- Must show compatibility with existing systems
- Hybrid approach is approval requirement, not nice-to-have
- Proposals ignoring this get scrapped (contributing to 42% rate)

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The 95% AI pilot failure rate is organizational]] - Scrapping is result of failed pilots scaling up
- [[Vertical AI beats horizontal AI]] - Vertical solutions more likely to integrate properly
- [[AI investment thesis flipped to defensive]] - Can't afford more failed scraps, need certainty
- **Contrasts with**: 2024's "transformation" narrative and big-bang replacement strategies
