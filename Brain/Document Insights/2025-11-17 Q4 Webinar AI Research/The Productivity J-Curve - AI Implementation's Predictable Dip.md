## Core Insight

AI implementation causes a predictable, measurable short-term DECLINE in productivity immediately after deployment - a pattern called the "Productivity J-Curve." This temporary dip is caused by organizational friction: the time and cost of unlearning old processes, integrating legacy systems, and redesigning workflows. **This J-Curve dip is the precise point where 95% of AI initiatives fail** - laggards panic when metrics go down, interpret it as failure, and kill the project. Leaders expect the dip, plan for it, and maintain executive commitment through it.

## Context & Evidence

**The Pattern:**
- Short-term productivity DROPS after AI implementation
- Caused by organizational adjustment friction, not technical failure
- Leaders understand this is a necessary investment period
- Laggards interpret the dip as ROI failure and abandon projects

**Why This Matters:**
This is THE primary cause of the 95% failure rate. It's not that the technology doesn't work - it's that organizations kill projects during the predictable adjustment period before value can materialize.

**Strategic Implication:**
The J-Curve separates "fail-fast culture" (disciplined learning) from "fail-chaotic culture" (abandoning every pilot that hits friction). Leaders use structured validation gates (like Michelin's two-gate PoC process) to give executives confidence to fund projects THROUGH the dip.

**Quantified Impact:**
- 95% of laggard initiatives fail specifically because they abandon projects in the J-Curve dip
- Leaders who master the J-Curve achieve 70% pilot-to-production success vs. 30% for laggards (2.3x difference)

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- Relates to: Change management, organizational transformation, investment patience
- Contrasts with: "Move fast and break things" - requires disciplined persistence instead
- Builds on: Understanding that transformation has upfront costs before returns
- Enables: Proper executive expectations, structured funding commitments, realistic timelines
