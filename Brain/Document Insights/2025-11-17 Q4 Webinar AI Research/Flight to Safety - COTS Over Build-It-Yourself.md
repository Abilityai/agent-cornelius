## Core Insight

The high failure rate of 2024's "ambitious DIY projects" has triggered a 2025 market-wide "flight to safety" where CIOs are reducing PoC/self-development efforts and pivoting toward commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions from trusted providers. The market now prioritizes predictable implementation and business value over speculative moonshots.

## Context & Evidence

**The Shift:**
2024: "General optimism and experimentation," "ambitious internal projects" driven by C-suite enthusiasm
2025: "Strategic and measurable approach," "focus on governance and ROI," shift from "what can it do" to "what did it do"

**CIO Behavior Changes:**
- Actively reducing PoC and self-development efforts
- Moving away from "build-it-yourself" projects (which fail 95% of the time)
- Moving toward COTS solutions from existing, trusted software providers
- Demanding predictable implementation with verifiable case studies

**Why the Shift:**
- CEOs no longer happy with PoCs - demanding tangible results (<30% CEO satisfaction despite $1.9M average spend)
- 30% of GenAI projects abandoned after PoC (Gartner)
- 40%+ of agentic AI projects will be canceled (Gartner)
- Risk fatigue from 2024's experimentation failures

**Commercial Implication:**
Significant tailwind for vendors who can provide:
- Proven, workflow-integrated solutions
- Verifiable case studies (not just demos)
- Predictable time-to-value (6-12 month window)
- Risk mitigation vs "science project" gambles

**Strategic Context:**
This isn't risk aversion - it's learning from failure. Organizations are seeking "ground game" wins (small, fast payback projects) to fund future innovation rather than betting everything on speculative moonshots.
