## Core Insight

95% of enterprise AI pilots stall before showing strategic results not because the AI models are bad, but because of a "learning gap" and fundamental "lack of alignment between technology and business workflows." The bottleneck is organizational change management, not technical capability.

## Context & Evidence

**The scaling crisis ("Pilot Purgatory"):**
- **95%** of enterprise AI projects stall before showing results (MIT 2025)
- Nearly **two-thirds** of organizations have not begun scaling AI across the enterprise (McKinsey)
- Only **39%** report any enterprise-level EBIT impact (McKinsey)
- **42%** of companies scrapped AI initiatives in 2025, up from 17% in 2024

**Why pilots fail** - MIT is explicit: "It's not the quality of the AI models, but the learning gap for both tools and organizations."

**The real blockers:**
- **Cultural resistance and emotional friction** - not technical issues (BCG)
- Lack of workflow redesign - only **21%** of organizations are redesigning workflows for AI
- **66%** of CEOs believe their business models are "not fit for AI purposes" (Gartner)

**The success pattern:** "AI high performers" are **3x more likely** to have fundamentally redesigned workflows. Value only comes from "rewiring how companies operate," not from bolting on generic tools.

**The failure pattern:** Most companies "try to jam probabilistic AI into deterministic, rule-bound systems... Neither works."

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Confirms adoption is about identity and culture, not tools
- [[Professional identity creates AI resistance]] - Why 66% say business models aren't "fit" - they'd have to change who they are
- [[Recreation beats comprehension]] - Can't just understand AI, must rebuild workflows around it
- [[Context engineering replaces prompt engineering]] - Need to redesign organizational context, not just tweak prompts
