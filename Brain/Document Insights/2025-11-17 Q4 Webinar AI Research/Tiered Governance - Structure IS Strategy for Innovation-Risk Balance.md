## Core Insight

The "move fast vs. manage risk" dilemma is resolved not through policy but through organizational structure - tiered governance models that apply proportionate controls based on risk level (fast lane, careful lane, deliberate lane). The structure IS the strategy, physically manifesting risk appetite in workflow design.

## Context & Evidence

**The Three-Tier Model (mirroring EU AI Act logic):**

**Tier 1: Minimal Risk ("Fast Lane")**
- Use cases: Internal productivity tools, Shadow AI, low-stakes summarization
- Governance: Light - Acceptable Use Policies, training, monitoring via AI Gateway
- Speed: Move fast

**Tier 2: Limited Risk ("Careful Lane")**
- Use cases: Process automation, marketing copy, customer chatbots (with human oversight)
- Governance: Formal registration in model registry, data validation, Human-in-the-Loop review
- Speed: Move carefully

**Tier 3: High Risk ("Deliberate Lane")**
- Use cases: Customer-facing automated decisions, financial/medical/legal/HR contexts
- Governance: Full risk assessment (NIST RMF), AI Council approval, runtime enforcement, independent audit
- Speed: Move deliberately

**Why This Works:**
One-size-fits-all governance kills innovation (treats all use cases as high-risk). No governance kills 88% of pilots through lack of production path. Tiered models provide the "governance bridge" that lets low-risk innovations move fast while high-risk applications get appropriate scrutiny.

**The Key Insight:**
This isn't governance documentation - it's workflow architecture. The organizational structure EMBEDS risk appetite into operational design, making governance automatic rather than discretionary.
