## Core Insight

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging as the "USB-C of AI agents" - a universal, open standard backed by OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft that eliminates custom "glue code" for connecting agents to APIs and databases. It will dramatically lower the hidden integration costs (the "iceberg") of agentic AI throughout 2025-2026, making "Platform + Custom" builds much more viable.

## Context & Evidence

**The Problem MCP Solves:**
- Today: Connecting an agent to each new API/database requires custom software project
- Brittle integrations break with API changes
- Months of engineering work per connection
- Creates "pipeline jungle" - unmaintainable integration code
- Frameworks like LangChain have "brutal learning curve"

**What MCP Provides:**
- Universal, plug-and-play standard for agent-to-system connections
- Like USB-C: One protocol, many devices
- Open standard with major vendor backing (OpenAI, Google, Microsoft)
- Reduces custom integration from project to configuration

**The Timeline:**
- Emerging in 2025-2026
- Will accelerate enterprise adoption
- Makes hybrid "Platform + Custom" builds economically viable
- Reduces the 80-90% hidden integration costs

**Strategic Implication:**
Companies waiting for MCP adoption before major agent investments may be making a smart move. Early adopters face the "glue code" nightmare. 2026+ adopters get standardized, maintainable connections.

**The Comparison:**
- **Pre-MCP**: Custom driver for every peripheral device
- **Post-MCP**: USB-C port works with any compatible device
- **Agent world**: One MCP connector, access to any MCP-compatible system

**What This Enables:**
- Smaller companies can build custom agents without massive integration teams
- Cross-platform agents become feasible (not locked to single platform)
- Faster deployment cycles (weeks not months)
- More maintainable, less brittle integrations
