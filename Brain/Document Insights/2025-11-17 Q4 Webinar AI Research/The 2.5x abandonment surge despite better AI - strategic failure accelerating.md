## Core Insight

The share of businesses scrapping MOST of their AI initiatives surged to 42% in 2025—a dramatic 2.5x increase from just 17% in 2024. This acceleration is the "defining data point of 2025" because it CANNOT be explained by technical failures. AI models demonstrably improved (GPT-4o, Llama 3.1) from 2024 to 2025, so this accelerating failure wave must be strategic. The market is shifting from technical failure ("it doesn't work") to strategic failure ("it's not worth it").

## Context & Evidence

**The Numbers**:
- 2024: 17% of businesses scrapping most AI initiatives
- 2025: 42% of businesses scrapping most AI initiatives
- Change: **2.5x increase** in just one year

**Why This Matters**:
- **Technology improved**: GPT-4 → GPT-4o, better capabilities across board
- **Adoption increased**: 75% of engineers using AI tools
- **Yet failures accelerated**: More projects being killed

**The Logic**:
- If technology was the problem → Better tech = fewer failures
- Reality: Better tech = MORE failures (2.5x increase)
- Therefore: Technology is NOT the problem
- Conclusion: **Strategic failure is the cause**

**What Changed 2024→2025**:
- 2024: PoC phase, experimentation, "let's try this"
- 2025: Reality check, executives "impatient to see returns" (Gartner)
- Projects that survived 2024 PoC phase now being cut in 2025
- Why? "Unclear business value" (Gartner)—the Vision Vacuum catching up

**The Pattern**:
1. 2024: Fund many PoCs in Use Case Trap
2. PoCs complete successfully (technically)
3. 2025: Executives ask "where's the value?"
4. No clear business value was ever defined
5. Mass abandonment (42% scrapping MOST projects)

**The Implication**:
- This is not random 42% failure rate
- This is MOST initiatives within 42% of companies
- These companies are doing wholesale strategic abandonment
- Recognition that entire AI portfolio was built wrong

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The Vision Vacuum creates the Use Case Trap - strategic failure cascade]] - The 2.5x surge is the Vision Vacuum's bill coming due; projects funded without strategy now abandoned without value
- [[Data problem is symptom not cause - strategic failure disguised as technical]] - Can't blame data when AI got BETTER; reveals strategic failure was always the real cause
- [[Shadow AI outperforms formal projects - the bottom-up paradox]] - While enterprises scrap 42% of formal projects, shadow AI usage grows; divergence shows formal strategy is broken
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy** - Organizations finally abandoning sunk costs after year of trying to justify them
- **Strategic Patience vs Impatience** - Executives impatient because no strategic roadmap to measure progress against
- **Market Correction** - 2024 = AI hype peak, 2025 = reality correction
