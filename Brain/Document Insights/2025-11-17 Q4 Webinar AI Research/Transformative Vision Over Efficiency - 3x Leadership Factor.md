## Core Insight

AI high performers are **three times more likely** than laggards to target "transformative change" through AI, explicitly linking it to **growth and innovation** as primary objectives rather than just efficiency and cost reduction. This vision gap is the primary source of the 95% P&L failure rate. Laggards pursue "random acts of AI" focused on efficiency - a scattershot of disconnected pilots averaging 6.1 simultaneous use cases. Leaders pursue focused transformation - an average of 3.5 high-conviction vertical (function-specific) use cases designed to create competitive moats.

## Context & Evidence

**The Vision Gap Quantified:**
- Leaders: 3x more likely to target transformative change (McKinsey 2025)
- Leaders: Focus on growth & innovation, not just cost cutting
- Leaders: Average 3.5 use cases, expect 2.1x greater ROI per case (BCG)
- Laggards: Average 6.1 diluted use cases, focused on efficiency

**The "Gen AI Paradox":**
Eight in ten companies adopted generative AI, but just as many report no significant bottom-line impact (2025 data). This paradox is caused by the vision gap - laggards chase horizontal tools (general chatbots) with diffuse, hard-to-measure value instead of vertical applications deeply integrated into competitive processes.

**Strategic Portfolio Distinction:**
- **Laggards**: Horizontal tools (general-purpose, easy to deploy, hard to measure)
- **Leaders**: Vertical use cases (function-specific, hard to deploy, easy to measure) - like Michelin's manufacturing quality control

**C-Level Ownership:**
High performers have senior leaders who demonstrate active ownership and role-model AI use themselves (3x more likely). They use AI as a "co-thinker" for complex strategic decisions, not just an automation tool.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- Relates to: Strategic vision, portfolio management, competitive advantage
- Contrasts with: Incremental thinking, cost-cutting focus, technology for technology's sake
- Builds on: Understanding that AI can reshape business models, not just improve margins
- Enables: Focused resource allocation, measurable competitive moats, board-level results
