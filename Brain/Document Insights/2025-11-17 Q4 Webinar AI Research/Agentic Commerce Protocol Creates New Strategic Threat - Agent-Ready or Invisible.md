## Core Insight

The Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) - an open standard by Stripe, OpenAI, and Salesforce - enables consumer AI agents to autonomously browse catalogs, ask questions, and execute purchases. This flips the e-commerce model: competition is no longer just other websites but being invisible to automated commerce agents. A 2025-2026 strategic imperative is ensuring e-commerce platforms are "agent-ready" or risk being shut out of a new automated sales channel.

## Context & Evidence

**What ACP Is:**
- New open standard for agent-driven commerce
- Co-developed by Stripe and OpenAI
- Supported by Salesforce
- Allows consumer-side AI agents to transact autonomously

**How It Works:**
1. Consumer's AI agent (e.g., in ChatGPT) browses merchant catalogs
2. Agent asks product questions autonomously
3. Agent selects products based on user preferences
4. Agent executes purchase on consumer's behalf

**The Strategic Threat:**
- Traditional e-commerce: Consumer searches, browses your site, purchases
- Agentic commerce: Agent searches across all ACP-enabled merchants, purchases
- If you're not ACP-compatible, agent cannot discover or transact with you
- You become invisible to an entire new commerce channel

**The Competitive Shift:**
- Old competition: Better website, SEO, ads
- New competition: Agent discoverability and transactability
- Not being agent-ready = not existing in this channel

**The Timeline:**
2025-2026 is the critical window to become agent-ready before this channel scales.

**C-Suite Implications:**
- E-commerce platforms must implement ACP compatibility
- Product catalogs must be structured for agent consumption
- Transaction flows must support autonomous agent purchases
- This is not optional enhancement - it's channel viability

**The Analogy:**
Like businesses that missed mobile commerce or refused to list on Amazon - being absent from the channel means being absent from revenue.
