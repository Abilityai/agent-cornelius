## Core Insight

The gap between 62% of firms experimenting with agentic AI and only 18% fully deployed is not a smooth adoption curve - it is a "Pilot-to-Production Chasm." Organizations are not failing to start agentic AI projects; they are failing to finish them. Pilot projects run in sandboxed environments with clean data, then collide with the reality of "enterprise plumbing." The high experimentation rate (62%) is therefore a leading indicator of future cancellations, not successful deployments. These organizations are not on a 12-month path to success; they are on a 6-month path to discovering the Foundation Gap.

## Context & Evidence

**The Statistics:**
- 62% of organizations experimenting with autonomous agents (McKinsey 2025)
- Only 18% have "fully deployed" these systems (Qlik 2025)
- 97% have funding in place for agentic AI (Qlik 2025)
- Gap represents a structural barrier, not a maturity curve

**Why Pilots Succeed but Deployments Fail:**
- **Pilot environment:** Sandboxed, clean data, controlled systems, limited scope
- **Production environment:** Fragmented systems, data silos, decades of technical debt, cross-system dependencies
- **The collision:** "Data quality, availability, and access" cited as top barrier, followed by "integration"

**The Hidden Truth:**
Most organizations celebrating pilot success have built the roof (the agent) before securing the foundation (the data infrastructure). The pilot "works" because it avoids enterprise plumbing. Production requires that plumbing.

**Quote:** Organizations "have, in effect, tried to build the roof (the agent) before securing the foundation (the data)."

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The Foundation Gap - AI Cancellations Are Architecture Failures Not Model Failures]] - Pilot-to-Production Chasm is the mechanism of the Foundation Gap
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Pilot success creates false confidence; production reveals technical reality
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Pilots let you code; production requires you to build infrastructure
- Contrasts with typical technology adoption - Most tech has smooth pilot-to-production; agentic AI has structural chasm
