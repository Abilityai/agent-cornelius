## Core Insight

A successful AI strategy uses the first win to fund the next, creating a self-funding, self-perpetuating cycle of innovation. The sequence: (1) Start with cost-saving win, (2) Reinvest P&L savings into productivity win, (3) Use productivity gains to fund revenue-generating win, (4) Use combined momentum to fund strategic transformation. This eliminates the need for large upfront investment and creates a virtuous cycle.

## Context & Evidence

The document provides explicit sequencing: Start with Customer Service or Back-Office automation (cost savings) → Fund Internal RAG or GenAI Content Platform (productivity) → Fund Sales Automation or LCNC apps (revenue) → Fund "Phase 3" strategic initiatives like custom builds or AI-ready data transformation.

Critical pattern: Each phase funds the next, building both financial resources and organizational capability. The transformation becomes self-sustaining rather than requiring continuous executive sponsorship.
