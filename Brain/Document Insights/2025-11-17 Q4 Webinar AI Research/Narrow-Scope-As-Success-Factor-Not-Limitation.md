## Core Insight

Narrow scope is not a limitation to be overcome but a critical success factor to be embraced. True quick wins automate single, high-frequency, repetitive processes (answering Tier-1 tickets, reviewing standard NDAs, generating first-draft copy) rather than attempting to solve complex, multi-step workflows. Success comes from doing 80% of simple tasks extremely well, not 100% of all tasks adequately.

## Context & Evidence

The document shows that successful use cases focus on high-volume, low-complexity, "intent-driven" tasks first. Red flag for false quick wins: "It will automate these 15 complex edge cases" or "It needs to pull from the CRM, ERP, legacy mainframe, and marketing data lake." True quick wins have 1-2 simple, API-based integration points.

The counterintuitive pattern: Constraint drives success. Width is the enemy of depth. Trying to do everything guarantees doing nothing well.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Context window bloat degrades performance despite more information]] - Narrow scope prevents cognitive overload
- [[Design agents to function without memory then enhance]] - Start constrained, expand strategically
- [[Agents lose big picture like humans lose forest for trees]] - Wide scope creates same problem for organizations
- Could connect to: 80/20 principle, Pareto optimization
- Could connect to: Focus vs. diffusion, strategic constraints
- Could connect to: Minimum viable product, progressive enhancement
