## Core Insight

The average employee experienced 10 planned enterprise changes in 2022, up from just 2 in 2016 - a 5x increase in organizational change frequency in six years. Now organizations are asking these same burned-out employees to adopt AI while 70% believe it will put their jobs at risk. This is the Culture Gap in action: technical readiness without organizational readiness.

## Context & Evidence

**The burnout statistics**:
- 2016: 2 planned enterprise changes per employee
- 2022: 10 planned enterprise changes per employee
- 45% of workers feel burned out by frequent organizational changes
- Only 37% can rely on manager to help through changes

**AI adoption context**:
- 70% of Boomers, 63% of Gen X believe "AI will put jobs at risk"
- 52% more concerned than excited about AI (up from 37% in 2021)
- Only 1/3 of companies prioritize change management and training in AI rollouts

**The compounding crisis**:
1. Employees already exhausted from constant change (5x increase)
2. 45% actively burned out
3. Now asked to adopt AI (perceived job threat)
4. Without adequate support (only 37% trust managers to help)
5. While companies skip change management (2/3 don't prioritize it)

**BCG finding**: 70% of implementation challenges stem from people and process issues. This isn't surprising when the "people" are experiencing change fatigue at unprecedented levels.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[84% of AI failures are leadership-driven not technical]] - Change fatigue is organizational failure, not technical failure
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - Can't have velocity when employees are burned out and threatened
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical - attachment to mental models]] - Change fatigue makes people cling harder to existing mental models as source of stability

**Novel framing**:
- Change frequency has acceleration limits
- Human organizational capacity hasn't scaled with technological change pace
- Each new initiative competes with "change budget" already depleted
- AI adoption timing couldn't be worse - arriving when organizational change capacity is exhausted
