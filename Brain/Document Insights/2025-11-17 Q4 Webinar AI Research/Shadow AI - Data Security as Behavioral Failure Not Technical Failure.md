## Core Insight

The #1 AI data security risk is not external attack or technical infrastructure failure but internal behavioral failure through "Shadow AI" - 58% of employees admit to putting sensitive corporate data into public AI tools because 77% are unclear on safe usage. The C-suite worries about the dam breaking while employees unknowingly siphon data out with a hose.

## Context & Evidence

**The Disconnect:**
- C-suite and boards perceive data security as a technical/external threat (database security, hackers)
- Reality: 75% of workers use AI, yet 77% are unclear how to use it safely
- Result: 58% of employees admit to putting sensitive corporate data into public tools
- Only 28% of organizations have formal AI usage policies

**The Mechanism:**
"Shadow AI" risk is the symptom of the "policy-to-practice gap" - the failure is not in enforcement but in even documenting the rules. This policy vacuum leaves employees to guess, with predictable data leakage results.

**The Metaphor:**
Leadership focuses on fortifying the perimeter (firewalls, access controls) while the actual threat is employees carrying buckets of data out the front door because no one told them not to.
