## Core Insight

The primary technical prerequisite for a 2025 quick win is a robust set of APIs, NOT a clean, centralized data lake. The new generation of "buy" solutions are engineered to work with messy reality - they rely on "ready-made connectors" and standard APIs to pull only the specific data they need, when they need it, from existing systems. The prerequisite is connectivity, not purity.

## Context & Evidence

This distinction is the antidote to the "AI-ready data" trap. Waiting for perfect, enterprise-wide data is a recipe for failure. Modern solutions use API-first mentality with pre-built connectors and standard APIs (REST, Webhooks) to integrate with existing, messy systems (CRM, ERP, WMS) rather than requiring complex, enterprise-wide data cleansing projects.

Success pattern: 1-2 simple, API-based integration points rather than comprehensive data unification.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[All memory ultimately becomes text in context window]] - Just-in-time data retrieval mirrors agent memory patterns
- [[Context window bloat degrades performance despite more information]] - Less data, better targeted, outperforms comprehensive datasets
- [[Design agents to function without memory then enhance]] - Same principle: Start minimal, add as needed
- Could connect to: Minimum viable product, lean startup methodology
- Could connect to: Just-in-time manufacturing, pull vs. push systems
