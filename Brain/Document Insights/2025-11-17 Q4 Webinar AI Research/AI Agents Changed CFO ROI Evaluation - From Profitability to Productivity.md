## Core Insight

61% of CFOs changed how they evaluate ROI specifically due to AI agents, with productivity overtaking profitability as the primary ROI metric for 2025. This fundamental shift in financial evaluation reflects CFOs recognizing that AI agents don't just automate tasks - they reshape entire workflows and the scope of what's financially measurable. As Salesforce CFO Robin Washington stated: "We're fundamentally reshaping the entire scope of the CFO function."

## Context & Evidence

**The Metric Shift:**

Before AI agents (2024 and earlier):
- Primary ROI metric: Profitability
- Secondary metrics: Cost reduction, efficiency
- Evaluation timeframe: Traditional tech ROI (7-12 months)

After AI agents (2025):
- Primary ROI metric: Productivity
- Secondary metrics: Profitability, efficiency, innovation, resilience
- Evaluation timeframe: Operational value at 12 months, financial returns at 24-36 months

**Why Agents Changed Everything:**

Traditional automation replaces specific tasks → measure cost savings (profitability impact)

AI agents augment workflows and decision-making → measure output increases (productivity impact)

**Example**: Traditional automation eliminates 5 data entry jobs → CFO measures $300K cost savings

AI agent assists 50 analysts in making faster decisions → CFO can't easily measure "fewer analysts needed" but can measure "30% more analyses completed" or "decisions made 2 days faster"

**The Measurement Challenge:**

Productivity gains are real but harder to quantify in pure financial terms:
- Analysts make better decisions faster → hard to put dollar value on
- Engineers ship features 20% faster → revenue attribution complex
- Customer service resolves issues in 7 fewer minutes → customer satisfaction up but revenue impact indirect

This is why 61% of CFOs had to change evaluation frameworks - old metrics didn't capture agent value.

**The Strategic Implication:**

This shift means AI investments can now be justified on productivity grounds even when direct profitability impact is unclear. This potentially loosens ROI constraints BUT also creates risk of measuring "activity" (productivity) rather than "outcomes" (profitability).

**Robin Washington's Insight:**

"We're fundamentally reshaping the entire scope of the CFO function" - AI agents aren't just changing what CFOs measure, but what the CFO role itself does. If agents handle financial analysis, forecasting, and scenario modeling, what does a CFO spend time on?

**The Risk:**

Shifting from profitability to productivity as primary metric could enable organizations to justify AI investments that increase busyness without increasing value. "We processed 30% more reports" doesn't matter if those reports don't drive better decisions.

**The Opportunity:**

Organizations that can connect productivity gains to business outcomes will satisfy both metrics - demonstrating operational value quickly (productivity at 12 months) while building toward financial returns (profitability at 24-36 months). This navigates the CFO ultimatum paradox.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Context engineering replaces prompt engineering]] - Agents require different evaluation than traditional tools
- [[The Folder Paradigm - agents own directories as operational memory]] - Agents as persistent workers require different ROI frameworks than one-time automation
- [[Agents as millions of new intelligences]] - Financial frameworks designed for tools don't fit entities with persistent memory and decision-making
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Productivity metric favors those who ship outcomes, not just write code
- **Questions raised**: Does productivity-first evaluation lead to genuine value or just AI-driven busyness? How do you prevent gaming productivity metrics?
