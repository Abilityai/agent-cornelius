## Core Insight

The three strategic gaps (Vision, Foundation, Adoption) are NOT independent failures but form a cascade pattern where Vision Gap enables both Foundation and Adoption Gaps, which then reinforce each other in a negative feedback loop. Organizations fail on multiple gaps simultaneously because upstream strategic failures propagate downstream into technical and human systems.

## Context & Evidence

**The cascade mechanism:**

**1. Vision Gap → Foundation Gap:**
- Without strategic clarity, organizations don't prioritize data governance
- 57% of CDOs haven't updated data strategy for AI (no strategic mandate to do so)
- Lack of central strategy leads to data silos and inconsistency across departments
- No clear use case prioritization means no clear data prioritization
- Result: Organizations with Vision Gap almost always have Foundation Gap

**2. Foundation Gap → Adoption Gap:**
- Poor model performance due to data quality undermines user trust
- When AI produces unreliable outputs, frontline adoption plummets
- Users blame "the AI" when root cause is data feeding the AI
- Trust disparity worsens as executives (who don't use tools daily) miss quality issues
- Result: Even with change management, bad data defeats adoption

**3. Vision Gap → Adoption Gap (direct):**
- Without strategic mandate, insufficient resources allocated to change management
- Only one-third prioritize change management in AI rollouts (no Vision = no resources)
- Lack of clear business case makes it hard to motivate adoption
- Pilots abandoned when champion leaves (no strategic continuity)
- Result: Tactical experiments can't command organizational commitment

**The reinforcing failure loop:**
1. Early pilot failures (due to any/all gaps) confirm skeptics' views
2. "We tried AI and it didn't work" becomes organizational narrative
3. Makes it harder to build strategic case for continued investment
4. Organization retreats to "random acts of AI" approach
5. Return to step 1 (more pilot failures)

**Why most companies fail on multiple gaps:**
- 80-95% overall failure rate reflects compounding effects
- Organizations with Vision Gap: 90%+ probability of having Foundation and Adoption Gaps
- Organizations can have Foundation/Adoption Gaps without Vision Gap, but rare
- Gap interaction explains why success rate is ~5-15%, not 40-50% (if gaps were independent)

**The sequence implication:**
You cannot successfully address Foundation or Adoption Gaps without first establishing Vision (strategic clarity, prioritization, governance, resources). Attempting to "fix data quality" or "improve change management" in absence of strategic context produces local improvements that don't scale.
