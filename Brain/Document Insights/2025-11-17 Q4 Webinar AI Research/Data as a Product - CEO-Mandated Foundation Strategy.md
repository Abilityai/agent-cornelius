## Core Insight

AI leaders have elevated data governance from a siloed IT problem to a **CEO-led "Data as a Product" (DaaP) strategy**. Instead of treating data as an asset or service, they treat it like a manufactured product with owners, governance, quality standards, and a marketplace. This strategic shift is the ONLY systemic solution to the "garbage in, garbage out" problem that causes 30% of AI projects to be abandoned at proof-of-concept stage due to poor data quality (Gartner prediction).

## Context & Evidence

**Data as a Product Characteristics:**
- **Owned**: Clear business owner responsible for quality (like a product manager)
- **Governed**: Packaged, clean, trusted, documented with metadata
- **Discoverable**: Available in central data marketplace for consumers (human and AI)
- **Value-Focused**: Explicitly designed to support AI initiatives and business outcomes

**Why This is a CEO Issue:**
BCG's 2025 analysis shows this is now a CEO-level mandate, not a CTO/CIO technical project. Leaders understand that data quality is the "raw material" for their "AI Factory" - without high-quality inputs, the entire manufacturing process fails.

**The Foundation Gap:**
- Only 2% of organizations rank as "highly ready" to scale AI (F5 2025)
- Gartner predicted 30% of AI PoCs would fail specifically due to poor data quality
- Laggards treat data as an IT problem; leaders treat it as strategic infrastructure

**Strategic Architecture:**
DaaP provides the raw materials for the "AI Factory" - an end-to-end system optimized for data ingestion, training, fine-tuning, and high-volume inference at scale. Without DaaP, the AI Factory has no feedstock.
