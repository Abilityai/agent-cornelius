## Core Insight

Gartner's prediction that 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027 reflects architecture failures, not model failures. The officially cited reasons - "escalating costs, unclear business value, or inadequate risk controls" - are symptoms of a deeper root cause: the Foundation Gap. Organizations greenlight AI projects on data infrastructure they know is insufficient (57% report data "not AI-ready"), then face massive unbudgeted costs when forced to build data integration, quality, and governance infrastructure mid-project.

## Context & Evidence

**The Causal Chain:**
1. C-suite greenlights ambitious agentic AI project (driven by 48% adoption hype)
2. Project proceeds despite 57% data readiness gap (the "known-unknown")
3. Team budgeted for agent development forced to spend on "enterprise plumbing" - data integration, quality, governance
4. Foundational data work (should be separate multi-year, multi-million infrastructure project) expensed against AI project's smaller budget
5. Budget balloons ("escalating costs"), timeline stretches with no deliverable ("unclear business value")
6. Project correctly canceled

**Key Quote:** "Projects will fail not because agents underperform but because costs escalate and governance takes a back seat... This is not a 'model problem,' it is an 'architecture problem.'"

**The Math:** 40% cancellation rate is the direct, lagging financial consequence of the 57% "not AI-ready" data statistic. The progression is predictable and preventable.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Psychological barrier at individual level; Foundation Gap is organizational/infrastructure barrier
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - They want builders, but Foundation Gap prevents building
- [[The Folder Paradigm - Agents own directories as operational memory]] - Agents need infrastructure to operate; folders are agent-level, this is enterprise-level
- Contrasts with technical AI limitations - Most AI failure analysis focuses on model capabilities; this reveals infrastructure is the real bottleneck
