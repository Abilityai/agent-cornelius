## Core Insight

"POC Purgatory" describes custom AI agent projects that absorb millions in R&D but never reach production. Less than 10% of custom AI projects move past pilot stage because the leap from simple demo to secure, governed, production system is 10x more complex than anticipated. Custom builds cost $600,000-$1.5M per agent with 90%+ failure-to-scale rate.

## Context & Evidence

**The Trap:**
- Company decides to build custom agent for competitive advantage
- Hires expensive AI engineering talent ($750K-$1.5M development cost)
- Creates impressive proof-of-concept demo
- Project stalls when trying to productionize
- Never reaches actual business value delivery

**Why POC Purgatory Happens:**
- **Complexity Explosion**: Demo handles happy path, production must handle all edge cases
- **Security Requirements**: Production needs complete security stack (20-30% additional budget)
- **Integration Nightmare**: Must connect to all existing systems with robust error handling
- **Governance Gap**: Need accountability frameworks, audit trails, monitoring that don't exist yet
- **Talent Shortage**: Requires 2-3 senior engineers per agent full-time

**The Statistics:**
- Less than 10% of custom projects reach production
- 90%+ failure rate to scale beyond pilot
- $750K-$1.5M sunk cost with no ROI

**The Production Gap:**
Production-ready queries consume 5x the tokens of demos because they must load conversation history, user permissions, and perform validation checks. This 5x multiplier applies to complexity, cost, and development time.

**Why Platform-Based Agents Escape POC Purgatory:**
- Security, governance, integration already built
- 4-6 week deployment vs 6-9+ month custom builds
- Proven production patterns, not experimental architecture

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - But implementation bottleneck is technical complexity
- [[Design agents to function without memory then enhance]] - Start simple to avoid purgatory
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Purgatory requires rare builders who can productionize
