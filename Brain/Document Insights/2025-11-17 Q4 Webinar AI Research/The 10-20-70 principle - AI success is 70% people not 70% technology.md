## Core Insight

The key separator between AI "high performers" and laggards is resource allocation: Laggards focus 70% of effort on technology. Leaders do the opposite - 10% algorithms, 20% data/tech, 70% people, processes, and cultural transformation. This inverted priority is what distinguishes success from failure.

## Context & Evidence

**The "10-20-70 principle"** separates leaders from laggards in AI implementation:

**Laggards (stuck in pilot purgatory):**
- Focus **70%** of effort on technology acquisition and deployment
- Delegate AI to CIO or "head of innovation"
- Treat AI as a technical problem
- Result: 95% pilot failure rate

**High performers (achieving 5%+ EBIT impact):**
- **10%** effort on algorithms
- **20%** effort on data and technology infrastructure
- **70%** effort on people, processes, and cultural transformation
- CEO personally leads the cultural change
- Result: 22.6% productivity gains, enterprise-level EBIT impact

**Why people matter more than tech:**
- "AI only delivers impact when employees embrace it. And that only happens when the CEO leads the charge" (BCG)
- "Cultural resistance and emotional friction - not tech - are the biggest blockers to adoption"
- Without addressing the 70% (people/culture), the 30% (technology) is wasted investment

**The CEO role shift:** From technology procurement (2024 focus) to organizational change management (2025 mandate). AI is now understood as a leadership challenge, not an IT challenge.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Validates that psychology > technology
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - Part of the 70% cultural work
- [[Professional identity creates AI resistance]] - Why cultural transformation is the hardest 70%
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Need people who can redesign workflows, not just deploy tech
- **Contrasts with**: Traditional IT implementations where 70% tech focus could work
