## Core Insight

"Pilot Purgatory" is the organizational trap where companies fund numerous GenAI PoCs at $5M-$20M each (Gartner data), then watch 30-42% of them get abandoned. The cost structure creates a massive sunk cost trap: organizations have spent millions on pilots that never reach production, can't justify killing them (sunk cost), but can't justify scaling them (no clear business value). They're stuck in purgatory—too expensive to abandon, too unproven to scale.

## Context & Evidence

**The Cost Structure**:
- GenAI PoC cost range: **$5 million to $20 million EACH** (Gartner)
- This is just the PILOT phase (not production)
- Includes: Infrastructure, data prep, integration, team costs, vendor fees

**The Abandonment Rates**:
- 30% of GenAI PoCs abandoned after proof-of-concept (Gartner 2025)
- 42% of businesses scrapping MOST AI initiatives (S&P Global 2025)
- Average: 48% of all AI projects fail to reach production (Gartner)

**The Math**:
- If company funds 10 PoCs at average $12.5M each = $125M invested
- 30-42% abandoned = $37.5M-$52.5M wasted
- Per enterprise, per year
- Multiplied across 95% of organizations failing

**Why Purgatory Happens**:
1. **Vision Vacuum**: No strategic filter for what to pilot
2. **Use Case Trap**: Fund many disconnected PoCs
3. **Sunk Cost Psychology**: "We've already spent $8M, let's keep going"
4. **Impatient Executives**: "Where's the return?" (Gartner)
5. **No Clear Value**: Can't justify scaling (no business value defined)
6. **Too Expensive to Abandon**: Can't admit $8M mistake
7. **Result**: Stuck in purgatory

**The 60% Pre-Pilot Rejection**:
- MIT found 60% of enterprise tools rejected BEFORE pilot
- This suggests: Even getting TO pilot is hard
- Which makes abandoning pilots even more psychologically difficult
- "We fought to get this approved, we can't kill it now"

**The Organizational Pattern**:
- Multiple PoCs running simultaneously
- Each at different stage (planning, piloting, stalled)
- No portfolio-level view or governance
- Resources spread thin across many projects
- None reaching transformative scale

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The Vision Vacuum creates the Use Case Trap - strategic failure cascade]] - Pilot Purgatory is the FINANCIAL consequence of Use Case Trap; funding PoCs without strategic filter
- [[The 2.5x abandonment surge despite better AI - strategic failure accelerating]] - The 42% abandonment is organizations finally escaping purgatory by admitting failure
- [[CEO-level governance most correlated with AI success]] - CEO governance prevents purgatory by providing strategic filter BEFORE spending $5M-$20M
- [[Trust as 4x organizational multiplier - 57 percent vs 14 percent differential]] - Low-trust orgs stuck in purgatory; high-trust orgs scale quickly (84% production in <6 months)
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy** - Classic psychological trap; "we've already invested so much"
- **Portfolio Management** - Failure to manage AI as portfolio with kill/scale decisions
- **Decision Paralysis** - Can't decide to kill or scale → stuck in middle
