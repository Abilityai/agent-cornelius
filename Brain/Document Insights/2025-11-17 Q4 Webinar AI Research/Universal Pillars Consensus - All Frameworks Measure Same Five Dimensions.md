## Core Insight

Analysis of all six leading AI readiness frameworks (McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte, BCG, MIT, Stanford HAI) reveals universal consensus on five core pillars: Strategy, Data, Technology, Talent/People, and Governance. Despite proprietary terminology and branding differences, all major consulting firms are fundamentally measuring the same business capabilities.

## Context & Evidence

**The Five Universal Pillars (with terminology variations):**

1. **Strategy/Vision/Ambition**
   - McKinsey: "Strategy"
   - Gartner: "Strategy"
   - BCG: "Ambition"
   - Deloitte: (Implicit in framework)
   - MIT: (Implicit in maturity stages)

2. **Data**
   - All frameworks: Explicitly named "Data"
   - Universal recognition of data quality/governance as foundational

3. **Technology/Platform/Engineering**
   - McKinsey: "Technology"
   - Gartner: "Engineering," "Product"
   - BCG: "Investment," "Research"
   - Deloitte: "Technology"

4. **Talent/People/Skills/Culture**
   - McKinsey: "Talent"
   - Gartner: "Culture," "Operating Models"
   - BCG: "Skills"
   - Deloitte: "Workforce Readiness"
   - MIT: (Explicit people-centered focus)

5. **Governance/Risk/Compliance**
   - McKinsey: (Implicit in "Agentic AI Mesh")
   - Gartner: "Governance"
   - BCG: (SSQC pillar in FAST)
   - Deloitte: "Governance, Risk & Compliance"
   - Stanford HAI: (Primary focus)

**Key Insight**: The failure to capture AI value is NOT from lack of knowing what to assess. The consensus is universal. The failure is in execution - organizations know they need these five pillars but fail to build them, particularly the people/culture pillar (the 70% problem).
