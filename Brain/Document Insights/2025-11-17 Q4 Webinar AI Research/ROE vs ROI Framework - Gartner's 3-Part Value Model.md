## Core Insight

Gartner's 2025 analysis bifurcates AI value into distinct categories beyond simple ROI: Return on Employee (ROE), Return on Investment (ROI), and Return on the Future (ROF). Different use cases should be measured by different primary metrics, with ROE serving as a leading indicator of future financial ROI.

## Context & Evidence

**The Framework:**

1. **Return on Employee (ROE):**
   - Measures: Engagement boosts, personal productivity gains
   - Primary metric for: Content generation, knowledge systems
   - Examples: Time saved, quality improvements, satisfaction

2. **Return on Investment (ROI):**
   - Measures: Real business outcomes, P&L impact driven by deep process change
   - Primary metric for: Sales automation, process automation
   - Examples: Revenue growth, cost reduction, capacity gains

3. **Return on the Future (ROF):**
   - Measures: How AI rewrites industry rules, creates previously impossible business models
   - Strategic value beyond quarterly metrics
   - Examples: Market position, competitive moats, new capabilities

**Why It Matters:**
Most companies fail because they try to measure everything with single ROI metric. This framework recognizes:
- Different use cases create value differently
- ROE (operational efficiency) is often the *first* value realized
- ROE serves as leading indicator for future financial ROI
- Some value is strategic (ROF) and can't be measured in quarterly terms

**Application Pattern:**
- Knowledge/Content projects → Lead with ROE metrics (95% faster retrieval, 70% time reduction)
- Sales/Process projects → Lead with ROI metrics (271% ROI, 3x capacity)
- Transformative projects → Include ROF considerations (market repositioning)

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- Related to: Measurement frameworks, leading vs lagging indicators, strategic vs tactical value
- Connects to: Multi-metric balanced scorecards, value attribution challenges
- Contrasts with: Single-metric thinking, purely financial ROI focus
