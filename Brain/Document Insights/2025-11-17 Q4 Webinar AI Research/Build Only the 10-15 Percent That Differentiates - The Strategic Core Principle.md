## Core Insight

The optimal enterprise AI strategy allocates "Build" resources to only 10-15% of the application portfolio - the critical functions that create proprietary, defensible competitive advantage. The remaining 85-90% should be sourced via "Buy" or "Blend" (integration). The most common and costly mistake driving the 95% failure rate is misalignment: building commodity applications that should be bought.

## Context & Evidence

**The Strategic Framework:**
- **Gartner's Rule**: "Buy what you can. Build what you must. Blend both to deliver value."
- **Quantified Allocation**: Build = 10-15% (strategic core), Buy/Blend = 85-90% (everything else)
- **Core Decision Filter**: "Build what differentiates you. Buy what commoditizes quickly."

**When You MUST Build (The Strategic 10-15%):**
1. **Proprietary Data**: AI trained on your unique data and workflows
2. **Core IP**: The AI IS the product - your defensible moat
3. **Data Sovereignty**: Regulated industries that cannot send sensitive data to third-party APIs
4. **Scale Economics**: High-volume needs where TCO Crossover makes "Build" radically cheaper

**Why Building Commodities Causes Failure:**
Building a commodity function (e.g., HR chatbot, simple content summarization) is the #1 strategic mistake because:
- Wastes valuable capital and elite talent on undifferentiated tools
- Creates no competitive moat (competitors use the same off-the-shelf solutions)
- Diverts resources from the 10-15% that actually matters
- Results in low-ROI projects stuck in pilot phases (the 95% failure trap)

**The 5% Success Pattern:**
The 5% of "AI-future built" firms that achieve 5x revenue increases and 3x cost reductions follow this discipline: they use AI to "reshape and invent" core business workflows (the 10-15%), not just automate commodity functions.
