## Core Insight

The "Buy" AI market is fragmenting from horizontal platforms (general-purpose LLM APIs) toward Vertical AI platforms (industry-specific solutions pre-trained on domain data). Vertical AI is the high-growth, high-ROI story of 2025 because these platforms solve specific, complex industry challenges out-of-the-box, delivering immediate measurable ROI while horizontal platforms face commoditization and contribute to the 95% failure rate due to inability to solve specific problems.

## Context & Evidence

**The Market Split:**

**Horizontal AI Platforms:**
- General-purpose LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Powerful but "not deep" - lack domain specificity
- Facing commoditization pressure
- Cannot solve specific, complex industry problems out-of-the-box
- Key contributor to 95% AI pilot failure rate (too generic to deliver P&L impact)

**Vertical AI Platforms:**
- Industry-specific solutions built for particular sectors
- Pre-trained on domain data (legal, medical, financial, etc.)
- Examples: Harvey (legal), Abridge (medical)
- "Solve the specific challenges of each sector" immediately
- Attract massive investment due to clear, quantifiable ROI
- Fastest-growing segment in AI market

**Why Vertical AI Wins:**

1. **Immediate ROI**: Pre-trained domain knowledge means faster time-to-value
2. **Problem-Specific**: Solves actual industry pain points, not generic capabilities
3. **Lower Implementation Risk**: Domain expertise built-in, reducing failure risk
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Often designed with industry-specific compliance requirements
5. **Reduced Customization**: Less need for expensive custom development

**Strategic Implication:**
For organizations making a "Buy" decision, a Vertical AI platform will almost always deliver more value for a specific function than a horizontal one. The smartest "Buy" in 2025 is to look for platforms that solve your specific industry's problems out-of-the-box rather than general-purpose tools that require extensive customization.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- **Related to**: Market fragmentation, specialization vs. generalization, problem-solution fit
- **Contrasts With**: Belief that general-purpose AI tools can solve all problems
- **Builds On**: Understanding that specificity often beats generality for business value
- **Enables**: Better vendor selection, faster ROI, reduced implementation risk
