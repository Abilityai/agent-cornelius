## Core Insight

Two-thirds of CEOs admit their current business models are fundamentally unfit for AI purposes, and they lack faith in their own C-suite's "AI savviness" to fix it. This crisis of confidence - where CEOs don't believe their leadership teams (including CIOs, CISOs, CDOs) are competent to navigate the AI era - has made closing the executive "savviness gap" a foundational prerequisite to any successful technology deployment.

## Context & Evidence

**The C-suite competence crisis:**
- **66%** of CEOs say their business models are "not fit for AI purposes" (Gartner)
- CEOs have low faith in their technology leaders being "AI-savvy":
  - Only **44%** view their CIOs as AI-savvy
  - Even lower percentages for CISOs and CDOs
- Top limiting factor for AI deployment: "inability to hire adequate numbers of skilled people"

**The strategic response - pivot from hiring to upskilling:**
- Can't win the hiring war for AI talent
- Must focus on "equipping current employees with skills needed to seamlessly incorporate AI into everyday tasks"
- **33%** of CEOs making "misstep" of NOT integrating AI into workforce and skills strategy (PwC)

**Why this matters:** If the CEO believes:
1. The business model is wrong, AND
2. The leadership team is incapable...

...then no amount of technology investment can succeed. This is why the "AI-savviness gap" became Priority #4 for 2025.

**The "AI-First Leadership" mandate:** AI can no longer be delegated to the CIO. BCG: "AI only delivers impact when employees embrace it. And that only happens when the CEO leads the charge." The CEO must personally champion cultural change and comprehensive reskilling to make the organization "AI-fit."
