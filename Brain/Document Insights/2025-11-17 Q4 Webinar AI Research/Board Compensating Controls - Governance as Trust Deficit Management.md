## Core Insight

Board-level AI governance structures (audit committees, independent assurance, AI-literate directors) are compensating controls built to manage a technology that 66% of directors still don't fully understand. Boards do not trust themselves or their management teams to oversee AI without these rigid guardrails.

## Context & Evidence

**The Trust Deficit:**
- 66% of directors admit "limited to no knowledge or experience" with AI (improved from 79% but still majority)
- Despite this, AI is now #1 reputational risk in 38% of S&P 500 10-K filings
- Board response: systematic creation of compensating controls

**The Compensating Controls:**
1. **Committee restructuring**: S&P 500 companies designating specific board committees for AI oversight more than TRIPLED in 2025
2. **Independent assurance**: Requiring "second set of eyes" from upskilled internal audit or third-party specialists
3. **Board composition changes**: 66% of companies adding board members with tech/emerging tech expertise
4. **Mandatory reporting**: Demanding AI risk reporting with "same rigor as finance and operations"

**The Pattern:**
This is not oversight born of competence but of recognized incompetence. Boards are building rigid structures BECAUSE they know they lack the expertise to evaluate AI risks directly.

**The Irony:**
The audit committee (financial reporting, internal controls, compliance) becomes default AI owner not because it's the best fit but because AI has become a material, auditable RISK first and a strategic opportunity second.
