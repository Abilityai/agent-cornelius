## Core Insight

MIT's Dr. Tom Redman reveals that many employees' "second job" is "cleaning up data" just to do their first job. This reframes data from the conventional "asset" narrative to reality: poor, ungoverned data is a liability - a source of risk and operational cost, not value. Gartner identifies "Data Availability and Quality" as the top AI implementation challenge.

## Context & Evidence

The "data as asset" framing is misleading for most organizations. In reality:
- Employees waste productive time fixing data quality issues
- Poor data creates downstream errors and rework
- Ungoverned data introduces compliance and security risks
- AI systems trained on poor data produce unreliable outputs

This is the "Foundation Gap" - attempting to build AI on a broken data foundation. The metaphor is building on sand: the structure (AI) is only as stable as the foundation (data quality and governance).

MIT research emphasizes that "transformation happens between your ears" but also in data practices - aligning "people, data practices, and decision-making around trust." Without this foundation, AI initiatives fail regardless of algorithmic sophistication.
