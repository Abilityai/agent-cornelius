## Core Insight

Quick-win AI projects are funded by Operating Expense (OPEX), not Capital Expense (CAPEX), and this is a critical enabler of speed. The "buy" solutions (SaaS, LCNC) are subscription-based, shifting the financial discussion away from large, complex, upfront CAPEX requests toward manageable, predictable OPEX line items. This is a much easier and faster request for a CFO to approve, lowering the financial barrier to entry.

## Context & Evidence

Small-team AI stacks are benchmarked at less than $50-$100 per user per month. An enterprise-grade RAG system can be licensed for $120K first-year cost. This OPEX model bypasses the approval complexity of multi-year CAPEX budgets and aligns costs with subscription-based value delivery.

Strategic insight: The financial structure (OPEX vs CAPEX) is as important as the technical solution in enabling rapid deployment.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Finding a confirmation of the belief creates a spike of Dopamine]] - OPEX approval gives faster dopamine hit (quick yes/no) vs. CAPEX uncertainty
- [[Uncertain Cue gives a higher Dopamine reward than certain one]] - CAPEX creates extended uncertainty period that's neurologically uncomfortable
- Could connect to: Decision-making velocity, organizational friction
- Could connect to: Financial planning, budget cycles
- Could connect to: Risk allocation, failure modes
