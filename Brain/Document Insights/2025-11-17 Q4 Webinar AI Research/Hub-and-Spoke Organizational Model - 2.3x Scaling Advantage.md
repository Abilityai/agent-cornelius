## Core Insight

The "centralized vs. decentralized" AI debate is over. Leaders use a hybrid "Hub-and-Spoke" model that is **2.3 times more effective** at scaling AI from pilot to production than purely decentralized approaches. Specifically: **70% of hub-and-spoke organizations successfully move pilots to production**, while only **30% of decentralized organizations** achieve the same. This organizational architecture is a PRIMARY differentiator separating leaders from laggards.

## Context & Evidence

**The Architecture:**
- **Hub (Centralized)**: Small elite team manages enterprise-wide governance, ethics, risk, data strategy ("Data as a Product"), AI Factory infrastructure, and vendor management
- **Spokes (Decentralized)**: Cross-functional pods embedded in business units (Marketing, Finance, Supply Chain) that handle use case identification, business alignment, last-mile adoption, workflow redesign, and KPI tracking

**Quantified Proof:**
McKinsey 2025 study of financial services firms found:
- 70% hub-and-spoke success rate
- 30% purely decentralized success rate
- 2.3x effectiveness multiplier

**Why This Works:**
- Centralized governance prevents "shadow AI" chaos
- Decentralized execution ensures business relevance and adoption
- Hub provides economies of scale (shared infrastructure, expertise)
- Spokes provide business context and change management proximity

**Strategic Implication:**
Organizational structure is not just about reporting lines - it's a quantifiable performance lever. The wrong structure (pure decentralization) caps your pilot-to-production success at 30% regardless of technology quality.
