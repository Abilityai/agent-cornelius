## Core Insight

"Pilot purgatory" is an established industry term for the phenomenon where 88-95% of AI pilots never reach production, not due to technical failure but due to isolation from strategic context, customer touchpoints, and cross-functional buy-in needed for scaling. Even when models work perfectly, they cannot be deployed across processes, systems, and teams without broader strategic alignment.

## Context & Evidence

**Failure statistics:**
- 88-95% of AI pilots fail to reach production (multiple sources)
- 46% of AI POCs abandoned before production
- Only 48% of AI projects make it into production
- 42% of companies abandoned MOST AI initiatives in 2025 (up from 17% in 2024)
- Average time from pilot to production for successful projects: 8-14 months

**Root cause - tactical experimentation without strategic context:**
- Organizations conduct isolated experiments without connection to strategic objectives
- Pilots run in departmental silos without cross-functional buy-in
- Many POCs are highly underfunded or not funded at all, lacking strong business cases
- Multiple departments launch independent pilots with no unified strategy or prioritization
- Experiments get abandoned when champion leaves organization

**Contrast with successful approach (top 26% of companies):**
- Focus on 3-5 high-impact use cases rather than dozens of experiments
- Document enterprise-wide AI strategy aligned with business objectives
- Establish centralized AI steering committee
- Result: 3x more likely to scale AI successfully, financial performance above industry average

**BCG finding:** Only one-quarter of executives who say their companies created significant value focused on a SMALL set of AI initiatives and scaled them swiftly (not dozens of random pilots).

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Pilot failures often organizational, not technical
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - Without strategic safety net, pilots stay cautiously small
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Strategic focus on 3-5 use cases requires builder mindset
- [[Professional identity creates AI resistance]] - Isolated pilots face resistance without strategic mandate
