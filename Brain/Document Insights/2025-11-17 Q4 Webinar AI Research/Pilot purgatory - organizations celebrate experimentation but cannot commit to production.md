## Core Insight

Organizations are stuck in "pilot purgatory" - launching 20+ GenAI experiments, getting excited about POCs, but operationalizing none of them. Deloitte found that two-thirds of organizations expect 30% or fewer of their experiments will be fully scaled within 3-6 months. Organizational culture celebrates experimentation but lacks the commitment mechanism to move to production. This is the Culture Gap manifesting: no executive mandate to move beyond testing.

## Context & Evidence

**The pilot purgatory pattern**:
- 90% of GenAI pilots not moving to production (MIT)
- 95% of GenAI pilots failing to deliver measurable P&L impact (MIT)
- 88% of AI prototypes don't reach production (IDC)
- Average POCs scrapped before production: 46% (S&P Global)

**Why pilots don't graduate**:

1. **Culture celebrates experimentation**: "Innovation theater" - launching pilots signals progressiveness
2. **No commitment mechanism**: No executive mandate to choose winners and kill losers
3. **Resource fragmentation**: 20+ experiments, none with sufficient resources to scale
4. **Success criteria undefined**: No clear threshold for "good enough to productionize"
5. **Risk aversion at scale**: Comfortable with small pilots, terrified of enterprise-wide deployment

**MIT's research findings** (150 leadership interviews, 350 employee surveys):
- Core issue: "Flawed enterprise integration, not AI model quality"
- Both tools and organizations face steep learning curves
- Over-focus on pilots: Organizations stuck in perpetual experimentation mode
- Disconnect from business processes: Pilots isolated from actual workflows

**The psychology**:
- Pilots provide "optionality" - feel like progress without commitment
- Production requires conviction - one bet, significant resource allocation
- Organizational anxiety prevents commitment to any single path
- Easier to start new pilot than scale existing one

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Strategic clarity declining while adoption soars - inverse correlation paradox]] - Pilot purgatory is symptom of strategic confusion; launching experiments substitutes for strategic decisions
- [[84% of AI failures are leadership-driven not technical]] - Pilot purgatory is leadership failure to commit, not technical failure to deliver
- [[AI project abandonment jumped 147% in one year - acceleration of failure]] - Pilot purgatory eventually leads to wholesale abandonment as patience runs out
- [[Change fatigue - employees experienced 10 planned changes in 2022 vs 2 in 2016]] - Each pilot is a "change" that creates fatigue without delivering value

**Novel framing**: "Innovation theater" - performative experimentation that signals progressiveness without requiring commitment or accountability. Pilots become psychological safety blanket.
