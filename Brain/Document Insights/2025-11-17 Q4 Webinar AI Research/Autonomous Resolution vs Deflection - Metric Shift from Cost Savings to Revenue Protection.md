## Core Insight

The C-suite metric for customer service AI has fundamentally shifted from "case deflection" (cost-saving but often negative customer experience) to "autonomous resolution" (revenue-protecting brand enhancement). An agent that resolves issues 24/7 in seconds is a powerful customer experience that protects and grows revenue, not just reduces support costs.

## Context & Evidence

**Old Metric: Case Deflection**
- Measure: How many customers did we prevent from reaching a human?
- Strategy: Point to FAQ, self-service portal, chatbot
- Customer experience: Often frustrating, feels like being blocked
- Business impact: Pure cost savings (fewer support staff)
- Risk: Damages customer satisfaction and brand

**New Metric: Autonomous Resolution**
- Measure: How many customer issues did we fully resolve without human involvement?
- Strategy: Agent integrated into CRM/backend systems executes actions
- Customer experience: Fast, accurate, 24/7 problem solving
- Business impact: Revenue protection through enhanced satisfaction
- Examples: Process return, update shipping, resolve account issues

**Production Performance:**
- Salesforce internal: 83% autonomous resolution rate
- OpenTable: 73% resolution rate within 3 weeks of launch
- Wiley: >40% increase in case resolution, 213% ROI, +10 point CSAT lift
- Esusu: 64% email automation, 10-point CSAT lift, 34% faster resolution

**Strategic Reframe:**
Not "how much can we save on support?" but "how much revenue can we protect through superior customer experience?"

**The Brand Implication:**
A customer whose issue is resolved instantly at 2 AM becomes a brand advocate. A customer deflected to an FAQ becomes a detractor.
