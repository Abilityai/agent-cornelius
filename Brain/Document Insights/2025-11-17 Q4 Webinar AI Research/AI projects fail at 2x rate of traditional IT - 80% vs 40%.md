## Core Insight

AI projects have an 80% failure rate compared to 40% for traditional IT projects - double the failure rate. This reveals that AI implementation introduces challenges fundamentally different from and more difficult than traditional software deployments. Organizations approach AI with IT project methodologies and discover their frameworks are inadequate.

## Context & Evidence

**Failure rate comparison**:
- AI projects: 80% failure rate (RAND 2024)
- Traditional IT: 40% failure rate
- Ratio: 2x higher failure for AI

**Why AI fails differently than IT**:

1. **Probabilistic vs deterministic**: Traditional IT is deterministic (input → predictable output). AI is probabilistic (input → distribution of possible outputs). Traditional project management assumes determinism.

2. **Data dependency**: Traditional IT depends on code quality. AI depends on data quality + code quality. Most orgs have mature code QA, immature data QA.

3. **Continuous learning vs static deployment**: Traditional IT: deploy and maintain. AI: deploy, monitor, retrain, redeploy. Different lifecycle entirely.

4. **Explainability requirements**: Traditional IT: "It works or it doesn't." AI: "It works, but can you explain why?" Adds regulatory/trust layer.

5. **Organizational change scope**: Traditional IT changes workflows. AI changes roles, decision-making authority, potentially job functions. Deeper cultural impact.

**RAND's key finding**: "84% of failures are leadership-driven, not technical limitations." Traditional IT failures often are technical. AI failures are organizational.

**What this suggests**: Organizations need AI-specific project management frameworks, not adapted IT frameworks. Current approach: "Take IT PMO methodology, apply to AI" → 80% failure rate.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[84% of AI failures are leadership-driven not technical]] - The 2x failure rate is organizational, not technical - leadership frameworks built for deterministic IT don't work for probabilistic AI
- [[GenAI has 2x higher failure rate than traditional AI - The GenAI Divide]] - Nested failure rates: GenAI > AI > IT (95% > 80% > 40%)
- [[IBM Watson trained on hypothetical cases not real patients - 4B dollar lesson]] - Data dependency is AI-specific challenge absent in traditional IT
- [[Change fatigue - employees experienced 10 planned changes in 2022 vs 2 in 2016]] - AI creates deeper organizational change than IT, hitting exhausted workforce

**Novel insight**: Technology advancement doesn't guarantee easier implementation. AI is genuinely harder to implement than IT, requiring new organizational capabilities.
