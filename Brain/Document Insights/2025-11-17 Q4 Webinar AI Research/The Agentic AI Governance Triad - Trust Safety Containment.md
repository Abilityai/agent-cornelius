## Core Insight

Before deploying autonomous agents, organizations must establish the "Agentic AI Governance Triad": (1) Trust & Accountability - defining who is responsible for agent mistakes, (2) Safety & Testing - adversarial testing ("red teaming") to find failure modes before deployment, and (3) Containment & Monitoring - kill-switches and "blast radius" limits for when agents fail.

## Context & Evidence

This triad synthesizes governance requirements from McKinsey's "Agentic AI Mesh" and BCG's "FAST" framework:

**1. Trust & Accountability**
- Clear assignment of responsibility for autonomous mistakes
- Managing both excessive trust (over-reliance) and insufficient trust (hampering adoption)
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) for approval, not just review

**2. Safety & Testing**
- Safety and Reliability Testing capability (non-negotiable)
- Adversarial testing ("red teaming") to discover how agents can be broken, misused, or manipulated
- Proactive failure mode discovery before production deployment

**3. Containment & Monitoring**
- Cybersecurity guardrails and access controls limiting agent reach
- Real-time monitoring to detect "compounded hallucinations" or cascading errors
- Automated kill-switches - the ability to "pull the plug" immediately
- "Closed environments" preventing unauthorized tool access

The litmus test for agentic readiness: **"Can we pull the plug?"** If an agent manages supply chains autonomously, what monitor detects cascading failures and what's the automated shutdown process?
