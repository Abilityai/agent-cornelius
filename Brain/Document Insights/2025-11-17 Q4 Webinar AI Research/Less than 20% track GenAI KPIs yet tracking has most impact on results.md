## Core Insight

McKinsey found that less than 1 in 5 organizations track KPIs for GenAI solutions, yet tracking well-defined KPIs has the most impact on achieving bottom-line results. Organizations are massively underinvesting in the single most impactful success factor.

## Context & Evidence

**The measurement gap**:
- Only 20% track KPIs for GenAI
- Yet KPI tracking is the #1 factor for ROI achievement
- 97% of enterprises struggle to demonstrate business value

**Why organizations don't track**:
- Focus on technical metrics (model accuracy, speed) vs. business metrics (cost savings, revenue, efficiency)
- Data scientists "fail to adequately understand business context"
- Only 1% of companies view GenAI strategies as mature
- Can build POCs but can't scale to enterprise-wide value

**The GenAI Paradox** (McKinsey):
- 78% of companies report using GenAI
- 78% also report "no significant bottom-line impact"
- The two statistics are identical because nobody measures properly

**What gets measured differently**:
- **Technical teams measure**: Model performance, latency, accuracy
- **Business needs to measure**: Revenue impact, cost reduction, productivity gains, customer satisfaction
- **The gap**: Technical success ≠ Business success

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Companies want builders not coders - AI shifts the skill demand]] - Builders measure business impact; coders measure technical performance
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical - attachment to mental models]] - Mental model that "good technology = good results" prevents ROI measurement discipline
- [[Context is perspective applied to information - the AI cognition pattern]] - Without business KPIs, organizations lack the context to judge AI value

**Novel framing**:
- The most impactful action is also the least adopted
- Measurement gap creates accountability vacuum
- "AI theater" persists because success is undefined
