## Core Insight

In 2024, Generative AI was treated as a separate, magical category. By 2025, that distinction has collapsed - positive ROI from GenAI is now on par with traditional predictive AI. Customers no longer "buy GenAI"; they buy solutions (sales automation, knowledge systems) and expect GenAI as an integrated feature enhancing core value.

## Context & Evidence

**The Forrester Finding:**
"Areas of positive ROI being generated from GenAI is now on par with traditional predictive AI" (2025)

**What This Means:**
- GenAI hype cycle matured rapidly (2024 → 2025)
- Market moved from "What can GenAI do?" novelty to "What business problem does this solve?" pragmatism
- GenAI became feature not product category
- Value measured by business outcome not AI type

**Customer Behavior Shift:**
2024: "We need a GenAI strategy"
2025: "We need sales automation that works - if it uses GenAI, fine"

**Implication for Positioning:**
- Don't lead with "GenAI-powered" - that's now table stakes
- Lead with business outcome and workflow transformation
- GenAI is implementation detail, not selling point
- Focus on ROI metrics not technology novelty

**Strategic Context:**
This convergence accelerates the flight to safety. Organizations care about:
1. Business value delivered
2. Predictable implementation
3. Measurable ROI
4. Workflow integration

They don't care about whether it's:
1. GenAI vs Predictive AI
2. Transformer vs GAN
3. GPT-4 vs Claude

**Market Maturation Signal:**
When customers stop asking about the technology and start demanding proof of business value, the market has matured. 2025 is that inflection point for GenAI.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Flight to safety - COTS over build-it-yourself]] - Part of same pragmatic shift
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Technology hype distracts from real barriers
- Related to: Hype cycle maturation, feature vs product, technology commoditization, outcome-based selling
