## Core Insight

GenAI spending is exploding to $644 billion in 2025 (up 76.4% from 2024), yet Gartner reports "expectations for GenAI's capabilities are declining due to high failure rates." This is an inverted relationship: more money flowing in as confidence flows out. Organizations are caught in an investment trap - too committed to stop, too unsuccessful to continue with confidence.

## Context & Evidence

**The investment trajectory**:
- 2024: $365B GenAI spending (estimated)
- 2025: $644B GenAI spending (projected)
- Growth: 76.4% year-over-year
- Yet: "Expectations declining," "Executives impatient," "Organizations struggling to prove value"

**The expectation decline**:
- Gartner: "Expectations for GenAI's capabilities are declining due to high failure rates in initial POC work"
- "Dissatisfaction with current GenAI results"
- "Executives are impatient to see returns on GenAI investments"
- Yet organizations "struggling to prove and realize value"

**The trap mechanism**:

1. **Initial hype** → Massive investment commitments
2. **Implementation reality** → High failure rates (95%)
3. **Sunk cost logic** → "We've already spent $X, must continue"
4. **Escalating commitment** → Spend more to "fix" failing initiatives
5. **Declining confidence** → Internal skepticism grows
6. **External pressure** → Board/investors demand results
7. **Investment increases** → Despite declining confidence

**Gartner predictions creating urgency**:
- 30% of GenAI projects to be abandoned by end of 2025
- 40% of agentic AI projects to be canceled by end of 2027
- Poor data quality, inadequate risk controls, escalating costs, unclear business value

**The psychological dynamic**: Organizations can't admit failure after committing billions, so they double down while privately losing confidence. Public commitment exceeds private belief.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI project abandonment jumped 147% in one year - acceleration of failure]] - Eventually sunk cost trap breaks → wholesale abandonment
- [[Strategic clarity declining while adoption soars - inverse correlation paradox]] - Investment surging while strategy declining - same pattern of action without understanding
- [[Less than 20% track GenAI KPIs yet tracking has most impact on results]] - Can't prove ROI because never defined it, but keep investing anyway
- [[Pilot purgatory - organizations celebrate experimentation but cannot commit to production]] - Investment goes to more pilots, not scaling successes

**Behavioral economics insights**:
- Sunk cost fallacy at organizational scale
- Escalation of commitment (Staw's research)
- Public-private belief divergence
- Investment momentum independent of results

**Novel framing**: "Investment trap" - too committed to stop (sunk costs), too unsuccessful to continue with conviction. Spending becomes leading indicator of future write-offs.
