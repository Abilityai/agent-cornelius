## Core Insight

BCG's research reveals that top-performing AI organizations dedicate only 10% of their efforts to algorithms, 20% to data and technology, and 70% to people, processes, and cultural transformation. This is the definitive quantification of why most AI initiatives fail - organizations focus on the 30% (technology) while neglecting the 70% (human factors).

## Context & Evidence

This finding comes from BCG's 2025 research "The Widening Gap" which found that 60% of companies reap "hardly any material value" from AI investments. The rule explains the fundamental misallocation of resources: companies treat AI as primarily a technology problem when it is predominantly an organizational change problem.

The research shows that only 5% of firms are "future-built" and these firms achieve five times the revenue increases as laggards precisely because they invest in the 70% - redesigning workflows, upskilling talent, and transforming culture around AI.

This aligns with MIT's finding that "transformation happens between your ears" and that "sustainable AI impact starts not with technology but with people."

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - The 70% is psychological and organizational resistance
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - The 70% requires different skillsets than pure technical
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - Part of the cultural transformation in the 70%
- Related to: The concept that most enterprise failure is execution, not strategy
