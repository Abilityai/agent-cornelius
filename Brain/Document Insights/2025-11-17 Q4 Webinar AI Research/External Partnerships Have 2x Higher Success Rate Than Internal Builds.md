## Core Insight

External partnerships see twice the success rate of internal builds for AI implementation, providing a statistically validated "implementation advantage" that directly mitigates the 75% in-house failure rate. This is the most important finding for de-risking strategic AI investments - the choice of execution path (internal vs. partner-led) is a key determinant of success, independent of the technical approach.

## Context & Evidence

**The Success Rate Data (2025):**
- 95% of all AI projects fail to produce measurable P&L impact (MIT Study)
- 75% of firms building agentic AI architectures on their own will fail (Forrester prediction)
- Only 5% of firms are "AI-future built" and capturing real value (BCG)
- Partner-led projects achieve 2x higher success rate than in-house builds (MIT Study)

**Why Partnerships Succeed Where Internal Builds Fail:**
1. **Talent Gap**: Most organizations lack "niche expertise," "sophisticated retrieval-augmented generation stacks," and "advanced data architectures" required for complex AI systems
2. **Proven Patterns**: Partners bring battle-tested implementation patterns that bypass common failure points
3. **De-risked Execution**: Replaces unpredictable R&D/talent costs with predictable project costs ($70k-$100k+ for enterprise)
4. **Faster Time-to-Value**: Partner expertise accelerates development from 6-18 months (in-house) to 3-6 months

**The Strategic Paradox:**
The 5% of successful firms DO "Build" what differentiates them, but for the 95% trying to follow their lead, a pure in-house "Build" is a high-risk trap. The rational path is **Partner-led Build** - combining the proprietary IP benefits of "Build" with the success rate advantage of partnerships.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- **Related to**: Risk mitigation strategies, capability development, talent constraints
- **Contrasts With**: "Not invented here" syndrome, assumption that internal builds create more value
- **Builds On**: Statistical validation of partnership models over pure in-house development
- **Enables**: Rational de-risking of strategic AI investments, joining the 5% of successful firms
