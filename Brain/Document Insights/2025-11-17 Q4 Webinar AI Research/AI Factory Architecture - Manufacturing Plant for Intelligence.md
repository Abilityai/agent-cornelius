## Core Insight

The "AI Factory" is the 2025 architectural answer to scaling AI - not a traditional data center but a **purpose-built "manufacturing plant for intelligence."** It's an end-to-end system optimized for the entire AI lifecycle: data ingestion → training → fine-tuning → high-volume inference at scale. Leaders build this once as foundational infrastructure, then use it to "manufacture" multiple AI solutions repeatedly and efficiently. Gartner's new paradigm is the "AI Sandwich" where AI is embedded everywhere (COTS apps, shadow AI, custom builds) and data/AI governance acts as the "bread" at top and bottom to harness, govern, and serve all sources simultaneously.

## Context & Evidence

**The AI Factory Concept:**
- **Metaphor**: Manufacturing plant vs. artisan workshop
- **Purpose**: Industrialize and scale AI repeatedly (like Michelin's 200+ use cases)
- **Architecture**: End-to-end pipeline from raw data to deployed intelligence
- **Optimization**: Purpose-built for AI lifecycle, not general-purpose computing

**Key Components:**
1. **Data Ingestion**: Consumes Data as a Product inputs
2. **Training Infrastructure**: Model development and experimentation
3. **Fine-Tuning Systems**: Adaptation to specific use cases
4. **Inference at Scale**: High-volume production deployment (the critical bottleneck)

**Gartner's "AI Sandwich" Model:**
- **Top Bread**: Data governance, AI ethics, risk management
- **Filling**: AI is "everywhere" - COTS, shadow AI, custom builds
- **Bottom Bread**: Data governance, quality control, infrastructure
- **Key Innovation**: Governance wraps heterogeneous AI sources, not monolithic stack

**Why Traditional Tech Stack is Obsolete:**
The old "bottom-up tech stack" thinking assumes centralized control. The reality is AI is being bought by departments, embedded in applications, and custom-built simultaneously. The AI Sandwich architecture acknowledges this distributed reality and provides governance layer to manage it.

**Strategic Implication:**
This reframes AI infrastructure from "buy the right platform" to "build a system that can harness any platform." The factory metaphor is powerful: you don't build a new factory for each product; you build ONE factory that can manufacture many products efficiently. This is how leaders achieve Michelin-scale deployment (200+ use cases).
