## Core Insight

GenAI projects are failing at nearly twice the rate of traditional AI/ML implementations. MIT's 2025 research shows 90-95% GenAI pilot failure versus 52% for traditional AI. This creates what MIT calls "The GenAI Divide" - the newest, most hyped technology has the highest failure rate, yet investment is skyrocketing ($644 billion in 2025 alone).

## Context & Evidence

**Failure Rate Comparison**:
- GenAI Projects: 90-95% failure rate
- Traditional AI/ML: ~52% failure rate
- Traditional IT: ~40% failure rate
- AI Leaders (benchmark): Only 4% achieve cutting-edge capabilities

**Why GenAI fails more often**:

1. **Infinite possibilities become liability**: Traditional ML has narrow, defined use cases (fraud detection, recommendation engines). GenAI's versatility means organizations don't know where to start, so they "start everywhere and fail everywhere."

2. **Cost structure unpredictability**: Traditional ML had predictable costs - sized infrastructure, trained model, deployed. GenAI costs escalate unexpectedly through API calls, compute for LLMs, continuous fine-tuning. CFOs getting "sticker shock."

3. **New risk categories**: Traditional AI had well-understood failure modes (model drift, accuracy degradation). GenAI introduces entirely new risks - hallucinations, IP concerns, brand reputation risks from public-facing chatbots.

4. **Enterprise integration complexity**: Core issue is "flawed enterprise integration, not AI model quality" (MIT). Tools and organizations both face steep learning curves.

**The paradox**:
- 78% adoption rate (up from 55% in 2023)
- Yet 78% also report "no significant bottom-line impact"
- Only 1% view their GenAI strategies as mature

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI agents struggle with prototype to production transition]] - GenAI amplifies this problem: 95% of pilots fail vs. general "prototype to production" gap
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical - attachment to mental models]] - GenAI's "infinite possibilities" create choice paralysis, triggering attachment to existing mental models as safe harbor
- [[Context engineering replaces prompt engineering - agent success is system design]] - GenAI failure is system integration failure, not model quality failure

**Novel angles**:
- Technology evolution doesn't guarantee easier implementation
- Newer technology can have higher failure rates due to organizational unpreparedness
- Versatility can be a bug, not a feature, at adoption phase
