## Core Insight

2025 academic research reveals a "stark gap" between AI agent hype and actual capability. Even the most advanced agents (Grok, Claude 2.5) fail to automate more than 3% of complex real-world tasks, and "get dramatically worse as you add more context." This capability gap is a primary driver of the 40%+ project cancellation rate.

## Context & Evidence

**ZDNET 2025 "Remote Labor Index" Study**:
- Tested leading AI agents (including Cognition's Devin) on real-world freelance tasks
- Result: Less than 3% automation rate on complex, multi-step projects
- Described as "terrible freelancers"

**CMU "TheAgentCompany" Simulation (2025)**:
- Systematically tested agents on realistic office work and software development
- Goal completion rates below 55% when interacting with complex systems like CRMs
- Consistent failure to "reliably complete real-world tasks"

**The Context Collapse Problem**:
- Agents excel at "superficial specialized tasks"
- Performance degrades dramatically with context addition
- Fail at complex, multi-step projects requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptation
- Unreliability makes them unusable for autonomous, high-stakes production workflows

**Why This Matters**:
Companies building "Formula One" agentic projects discover they have a "go-kart engine." The gap between:
- **Promised**: Autonomous software engineers, digital workers completing projects independently
- **Actual**: Tools that handle simple tasks but collapse under real-world complexity

**The Reliability Threshold**:
<55% success rate is catastrophically insufficient for autonomous production deployment. Traditional software requires 99%+ reliability; even 90% means 1-in-10 failures - unacceptable for business-critical workflows.

**Strategic Implication**:
This explains why:
- 90% of vertical (complex) use cases stuck in pilot
- 42% of projects abandoned
- Only simple, bounded tasks (like atmira's debt collection with clear rules) succeed

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Context window bloat degrades performance despite more information]] - Adding context makes agents worse, not better
- [[Agents lose big picture like humans lose forest for trees]] - Context collapse = losing the forest
- [[Design agents to function without memory then enhance]] - Success requires minimizing context dependency
- [[The GenAI Divide - 95 Percent Failure Pattern]] - Capability gap prevents most pilots from reaching production
- [[Agent Washing]] - Vendors oversell capabilities, creating expectation-reality gap
- [[All memory ultimately becomes text in context window]] - Context collapse is fundamental architecture limitation
