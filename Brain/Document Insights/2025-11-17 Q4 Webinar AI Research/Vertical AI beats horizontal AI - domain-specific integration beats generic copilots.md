## Core Insight

CEOs are rejecting "generic copilots" and "horizontal AI" tools that give every employee a chatbot. The projects that survive and scale in 2025 are "Vertical AI" solutions - domain-specific applications deeply integrated into specific functions, compliance-aware, and designed to fundamentally change a core business process rather than merely augment it with AI features.

## Context & Evidence

**The horizontal vs. vertical divide:**

**Horizontal AI (failing - 95% failure rate):**
- Generic copilots and chatbots for everyone
- Low-specificity, low-integration
- "AI washing" - superficial investments for market positioning
- Bolted onto existing workflows without changing them
- The 95% that fail and never escape the lab

**Vertical AI (scaling successfully):**
- Domain-specific for particular functions (e.g., insurance claims, software engineering)
- Deeply integrated into core systems and workflows
- Compliance-aware and function-specific
- Changes HOW work is done, not just adds a tool
- Examples: claims adjustment systems, code generation for specific platforms

**Why vertical wins:**
- Addresses specific pain points with measurable impact
- Integrates with existing systems rather than replacing them
- Compliance built in for regulated functions
- Changes workflow = unlocks the value (the 21% doing this see results)

**The investment decision criteria:**
- CEOs saying YES: "This isn't a chatbot. This is a complete redesign of our insurance claims process. It integrates directly with our core system, uses our proprietary data to flag fraud, and will cut our average claim resolution time from 15 days to 2. It changes the workflow."
- CEOs saying NO: "This is 'AI washing.' Where is the P&L impact? Don't bring me another proof of concept. Bring me a production-ready, scalable plan."

**The strategic implication:** Stop trying to deploy AI horizontally across the organization. Instead, identify specific domains/functions where vertical integration can fundamentally redesign the core process.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The 95% AI pilot failure rate is organizational]] - Horizontal tools fail because they don't change processes
- [[Recreation beats comprehension]] - Vertical AI forces recreation of the workflow
- [[Context engineering replaces prompt engineering]] - Vertical AI bakes context into the system
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological]] - Easier to change one function than whole company
- **Contrasts with**: Generic AI assistants and horizontal deployment strategies
