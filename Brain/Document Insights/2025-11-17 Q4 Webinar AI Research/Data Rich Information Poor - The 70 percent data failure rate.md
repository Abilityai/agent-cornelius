## Core Insight

Organizations are drowning in data but starving for AI-ready information: 70%+ of AI failures are linked directly to data problems (not algorithmic shortcomings), with 92.7% of executives citing data as their biggest barrier. The paradox is having petabytes of data while simultaneously being unable to use it for AI because it's fragmented, inconsistent, ungoverned, and fundamentally not fit for purpose.

## Context & Evidence

**The overwhelming evidence for data as primary failure cause:**
- 70%+ of AI project failures linked directly to data problems, not algorithms (Gartner, Deloitte, McKinsey consensus)
- 92.7% of executives identified data as most significant barrier to AI implementation (NewVantage 2024)
- 43% of CDOs cite data quality and readiness as top obstacle (CDO Insights 2025)
- 46% of CDOs cite ensuring data quality as biggest roadblock to GenAI benefits (MIT CDOIQ 2024)
- Organizations lose average of $12.9 million annually due to poor data quality (Gartner 2024)

**Gartner's dire predictions:**
- Through 2025: At least 50% of generative AI projects will be abandoned at pilot stage due to poor data quality
- Through 2026: Organizations will abandon 60% of AI projects unsupported by AI-ready data
- 85% of organizations cite data quality as biggest anticipated challenge to AI strategies in 2025

**The readiness gap:**
- Only 10% of organizations feel "completely ready" to adopt AI from data perspective
- 57% of CDOs have NOT yet made necessary changes to their data strategy to support generative AI
- 69% of AI leaders cite poor data quality and infrastructure as #1 barrier to deployment

**Why "data rich, information poor":**
- Data is fragmented across silos, inconsistent in quality, challenging to unify
- Poor data quality includes inconsistent formats, missing values, duplicate entries
- Data quality now extends to unstructured data (new challenge beyond traditional structured data quality)
- Having data ≠ having AI-ready data (governed, clean, accessible, documented, representative)

**The investment misalignment:**
Organizations invest heavily in AI models and compute while neglecting the data foundations those models require, then blame "the AI" when projects fail due to garbage-in-garbage-out dynamics.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Yet data is technical bottleneck (both exist)
- [[All memory ultimately becomes text in context window]] - Data quality determines context quality
- [[Context window bloat degrades performance despite more information]] - Bad data = worse than no data
- [[Recreation beats comprehension]] - Can't recreate accurately from corrupted data
