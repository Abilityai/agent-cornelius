## Core Insight

"Agent washing" is the practice of vendors deceptively rebranding simple chatbots or RPA scripts as "agentic AI," creating a massive gap between promised autonomy and delivered capability. Gartner predicts over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027, with agent washing as the primary driver. Only 130 of thousands of "agentic" vendors are real.

## Context & Evidence

**What Agent Washing Looks Like:**
- Legacy chatbots renamed as "AI agents"
- RPA scripts marketed as autonomous agents
- Assistive tools (suggest only) sold as agentic (acts autonomously)
- Massive disconnect between marketing claims and technical reality

**Why It Fails:**
- Executives approve six-figure purchases expecting autonomous digital laborers
- Receive glorified chatbots that only respond to prompts
- Projects fail to deliver ROI because technology lacks "maturity and agency to autonomously achieve complex business goals"
- Budget wasted, trust damaged, AI initiatives stalled

**The Scale of the Problem:**
- Gartner: Over 40% of agentic AI projects canceled by 2027
- Only 130 real agentic vendors among thousands claiming the label
- Represents majority of market offerings are fraudulent

**The Critical Due Diligence Question:**
"Does this system autonomously take action and make decisions within our business systems, or does it only respond to prompts and make suggestions?"

**Real vs. Fake Distinction:**
- **Real Agentic**: Processes return, updates CRM, approves invoice autonomously
- **Agent Washed**: Suggests you might want to process return, drafts email, flags invoice for review
