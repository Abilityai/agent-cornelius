## Core Insight

McKinsey's 2025 analysis explicitly identifies **"fundamentally redesigning individual workflows"** as the single biggest driver of EBIT impact from AI - more important than model selection, data quality, or technology infrastructure. Leaders treat AI adoption as a workflow redesign problem, not a technology deployment problem. Laggards "bolt on" AI tools to existing (often broken) processes and wonder why there's no value. Leaders recognize that value comes from the NEW work process the AI enables, not from the AI itself.

## Context & Evidence

**The Core Finding:**
- Workflow redesign = #1 driver of EBIT impact (McKinsey 2025)
- This aligns with the 10-20-70 rule (70% on people/process)
- Leaders invest in redesigning work BEFORE deploying technology

**Why Bolting-On Fails:**
- Creates "silicon ceiling" - AI hits limits of broken process
- Employees resist because tools don't fit actual workflows
- No value capture because the process itself wasn't improved
- BCG found 75% of leaders use AI weekly, but only 51% of frontline workers do (adoption stalled)

**Deutsche Telekom Case Study:**
Perfect example of workflow redesign as strategy:
- Didn't just deploy tools to 8,000 agents
- Built AI-powered capability engine for personalized training
- Redesigned training/coaching workflow WITH AI
- Redesigned customer service workflow AS RESULT
- Results: +14 NPS, +10% first-time resolution rate

**Strategic Implication:**
This reframes AI from "automation tool" to "catalyst for process transformation." The question isn't "where can we add AI?" but "which workflows should we fundamentally redesign, and how can AI enable that redesign?"
