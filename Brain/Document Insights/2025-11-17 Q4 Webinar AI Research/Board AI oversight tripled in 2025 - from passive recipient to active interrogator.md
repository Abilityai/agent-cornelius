## Core Insight

Board-level AI risk oversight mentions tripled from 16% to 48% in 2025 proxy statements, and formal committee assignments quadrupled from 11% to 40%. Boards shifted from passive recipients of transformation stories to active, fiduciary-driven interrogators demanding P&L impact and risk assurance. The most telling underlying question boards now ask: "How do we know?"

## Context & Evidence

**The board governance escalation:**
- **48%** of firms now cite AI risk as part of board's oversight (triple from 16% in 2024)
- **40%** formally assigned AI oversight to specific committees (4x from 11% in 2024)
- **44%** of director bios now list AI qualifications (up from 26% in 2024)
- Boards establishing "AI board education programs" to properly carry out fiduciary responsibility

**The new oversight model:**
1. **Formal Committee Assignment**: AI escalated from full-board topic to committee-level responsibility (Audit, Risk, or new Technology committees)
2. **Board-Level Education**: Boards closing their own "savviness gap" with education programs
3. **Director Recruitment**: Actively changing board composition to recruit AI expertise

**The shift in mindset:**
- 2024: Board as passive recipient - "trusting the technologist"
- 2025: Board operating with mandate for verification - "How do we know?"
- No longer accepting transformation stories; demanding measurable impact
- Questions are pointed, data-driven, focused on risk, cost, and integration

**Key board questions reveal the shift:**
- "How are outcomes from AI programs measured? What are the KPIs?"
- "What are the specific risks for our expected uses of AI? Can they be quantified?"
- "How much will AI cost, and what is the expected return on investment?"
- "How are we managing the 'Shadow AI' risk from unauthorized tools?"
- "Does the current board possess adequate expertise to properly perform oversight over AI?"

**Why boards escalated:** The "AI trust gap" is real. The 95% pilot failure rate, Shadow AI crisis, and lack of enterprise-level EBIT impact forced boards to stop accepting CEO assurances and start demanding proof.
