## Core Insight

High-performing AI adopters are three times more likely to fundamentally redesign workflows rather than layer AI onto existing processes. This single factor is the primary differentiator separating the 5% winners from 95% failures - more important than budget, technology choice, or talent.

## Context & Evidence

**The Pattern:**
- Laggards: "Layer AI on top of current processes" or "automate mediocre processes" → "only accelerates mediocre outcomes"
- Winners: Re-architect business processes, decision points, and task ownership around AI capabilities

**Why It Matters:**
Laggards focus on the *tool* (buying AI, deploying models).
Leaders focus on the *process* (redesigning how work gets done).

**The 10-20-70 Rule:**
High performers allocate AI efforts:
- 10% to algorithms and models (technology)
- 20% to data and infrastructure
- 70% to people, processes, and cultural transformation

Laggards invert this - spending 90% on technology and wondering why they see no return.

**Measurement Implication:**
Measuring the *process output* (not tool usage) provides clean attribution of value. Baseline old workflow → measure redesigned AI workflow → clear ROI attribution.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Resistance to workflow change
- [[Context engineering replaces prompt engineering]] - Process design over tool optimization
- [[The Folder Paradigm - agents own directories as operational memory]] - Structural redesign for agents
- Contrasts with: Tool-first thinking, technology-centric adoption, "AI as feature"
