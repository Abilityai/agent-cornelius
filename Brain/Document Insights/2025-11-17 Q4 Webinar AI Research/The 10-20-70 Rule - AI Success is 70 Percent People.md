## Core Insight

AI leaders allocate resources according to the **10-20-70 principle**: only 10% of effort goes to algorithms, 20% to data and technology infrastructure, and **70% to people, processes, and cultural transformation**. This resource allocation is the opposite of what laggards do (who focus 90%+ on technology). The 70% investment manifests as workflow redesign, training (2x more than laggards), change management, and organizational restructuring.

## Context & Evidence

**The Breakdown:**
- **10%**: Algorithm development and model selection
- **20%**: Data infrastructure and technology stack
- **70%**: People (upskilling, training), Process (workflow redesign), Culture (change management)

**Validation in Practice:**
- Companies that "reshape workflows" provide 59% of employees with 5+ hours of training
- Companies that just "deploy tools" provide only 36% with 5+ hours (BCG 2025)
- This 2x training investment directly correlates with success rates

**Why This is Counterintuitive:**
Most organizations treat AI as a technology purchase. Leaders treat it as an organizational transformation that happens to use technology. The technology is the easy part - the human systems are the constraint.

**Strategic Implication:**
This explains why AI adoption is fundamentally a change management challenge, not a technical one. It validates why ServiceNow and Moderna created the "Chief Human and AI Resources Officer" role - they organizationally fused HR and AI deployment at the C-suite level.
