## Core Insight

Gartner warns against "agentwashing" - the common misconception of calling a simple generative AI chatbot an "autonomous agent." This mislabeling misleads organizations about true capabilities and risks, preventing appropriate governance and creating false expectations about what the system can actually do.

## Context & Evidence

Gartner provides the "Five Stages of Agentic AI Evolution" taxonomy to clarify the distinction:
- **Stage 1**: AI Assistants (embedded in apps, respond to queries)
- **Stage 2**: Task-Specific Agent Applications (execute specific tasks autonomously)
- **Stage 3**: Collaborative AI Agents (multiple agents working together)
- **Stage 4**: AI Agent Ecosystems (agents collaborating across applications)
- **Stage 5**: Democratized agent creation by users

Most systems marketed as "agents" in 2025 are actually Stage 1 assistants. True autonomy (Stages 2+) requires qualitatively different architecture, governance, and risk management.

Stanford's RE-Bench research reinforces this: tests show "current AI models are far from ready for direct deployment in agentic settings." The gap between marketing claims and actual capability creates strategic confusion.
