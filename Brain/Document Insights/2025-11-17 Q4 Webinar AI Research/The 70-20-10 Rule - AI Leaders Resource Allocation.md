## Core Insight

AI leaders allocate resources in precisely the inverse pattern from typical organizations: 70% to people and processes, 20% to technology and data, 10% to algorithms - while most organizations obsess over models and technology while neglecting the human systems that determine actual adoption and value capture.

## Context & Evidence

**AI Leaders' allocation (McKinsey research):**
- 70% → People and processes
- 20% → Technology and data
- 10% → Algorithms

**Most organizations (inverted):**
- Majority of focus on technology and algorithms
- Minimal investment in change management
- Result: Technical success, adoption failure

**Supporting evidence:**
- "Companies need to focus two-thirds of their effort and resources on people-related capabilities" (McKinsey)
- "The key factors for scaling AI are largely people- and process-related, including change management, product development, workflow optimization, AI talent, and governance" (McKinsey)
- Only one-third of companies in late 2024 prioritized change management and training as part of AI rollouts
- Yet enterprises that integrate change management are 47% more likely to meet objectives

**The paradox:**
Organizations invest heavily in obtaining the latest models and computing power while under-investing in the change management, training, and process redesign that actually determines whether deployed AI gets used and creates value.

**Result differential:**
- With proper people/process investment: 20-30% efficiency gains, 66% performance boost
- Without: Technical tools that sit unused, 23% adoption rates on perfectly functioning AI

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - 70% on people because psychology is the bottleneck
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - People investment creates safety for rapid adoption
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Builders understand systems require human alignment
- [[Professional identity creates AI resistance]] - 70% people investment needed to address identity threats
