## Core Insight

Gartner estimates that of "thousands of agentic AI vendors," only about 130 are real. The vast majority are "agent washing" - rebranding existing chatbots, RPA tools, and AI assistants as "agentic AI" without substantial autonomous capabilities. This procurement failure leads directly to the 42% project abandonment rate.

## Context & Evidence

**Gartner June 2025 Warning**:
- Thousands of vendors claim "agentic AI" capabilities
- Only ~130 actually provide true agent functionality
- Most are "rebranding of existing products, such as AI assistants, robotic process automation (RPA) and chatbots, without substantial agentic capabilities"
- Analyst quote: "Most agentic AI projects right now are early stage experiments or proof of concepts that are mostly driven by hype and are often misapplied"

**The Misrepresentation Pattern**:
Vendors rebrand products that:
- Only answer questions (chatbots) as "agents"
- Execute single predetermined scripts (RPA) as "autonomous agents"
- Require human confirmation for every action (assistants) as "agentic AI"

**True Agentic Capability Requirements**:
- Autonomously execute multi-step workflows
- Make decisions based on complex criteria
- Integrate with 3rd party tools and systems
- Adapt behavior based on context and outcomes
- Act with minimal human intervention

**Financial Impact**:
Companies spend millions on "escalating costs" for mislabeled chatbots, leading to:
- "Unclear business value"
- "Lack of maturity and agency to autonomously achieve complex business goals"
- Eventual project cancellation (42% abandonment rate)

**The Procurement Challenge**:
Enterprises must establish "No-Chatbot" rules for agentic AI budgets and require vendors to prove autonomous multi-step execution capability before purchase.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The GenAI Divide - 95 Percent Failure Pattern]] - Agent washing is why companies can't find real solutions
- [[Confirmation bias shapes AI agent evaluation]] - Vendors exploit executives' desire to believe AI will solve problems easily
- [[Hype cycle peak of inflated expectations]] - Agent washing thrives during hype peaks
- [[Professional identity creates AI resistance]] - Technical teams may not challenge vendor claims due to knowledge gaps
- [[Reality creation will become competitive lever]] - Vendors literally creating false reality about product capabilities
