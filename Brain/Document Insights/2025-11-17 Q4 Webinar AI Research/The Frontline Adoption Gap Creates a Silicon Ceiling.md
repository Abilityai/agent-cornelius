## Core Insight

BCG research identifies a "silicon ceiling" where AI tools are adopted by leadership but regular use among frontline employees has "stalled" at 51%. This creates a critical failure mode: leaders use AI while frontline workers don't, preventing the workflow transformation where real enterprise value is unlocked.

## Context & Evidence

The research reveals a stark usage gap - executives and managers adopt AI tools enthusiastically, but frontline employees who execute the actual workflows remain stuck in legacy processes. This "silicon ceiling" prevents AI from reaching the operational layer where most business value is actually created.

The failure mode is structural: without redesigning workflows, providing proper training, and creating incentives for frontline adoption, AI remains a management toy rather than an enterprise transformation tool. The 70% problem (people/process) manifests most acutely at this frontline layer.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The 10-20-70 Rule - AI Success is 70 Percent People and Process]] - The frontline gap is evidence of neglecting the 70%
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Frontline resistance is psychological, not capability-based
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - Frontline adoption requires safety to experiment
- Related to: Organizational hierarchy creating innovation barriers
