## Core Insight

Tracking well-defined KPIs is the #1 practice correlated with bottom-line (EBIT) impact from AI, yet only 15% of business leaders have established formal metrics. Even worse, the percentage measuring "process effectiveness" dropped from 81% to 75% in 2025 - a significant "missed opportunity" per Deloitte.

## Context & Evidence

**The Data:**
- Tracking KPIs = #1 driver of profit impact (McKinsey)
- Only 15% of business leaders have formal AI metrics (KPMG)
- KPMG finding: 68% spending $50M+ but *none* believed they had reached stage of measuring ROI
- Deloitte: Drop in measuring "process effectiveness" (81% → 75%) despite this being core AI value driver

**The Paradox:**
Organizations know measurement matters, but:
- Don't know what to measure
- Don't have baseline data
- Focus on vanity metrics (adoption %, tool usage) instead of outcome metrics
- Measure the tool not the process

**Why It Matters:**
Without measurement:
- Can't attribute value → Can't justify continued investment
- Can't separate signal from noise → Fund wrong initiatives
- Can't learn and iterate → Repeat same mistakes
- Become part of 95% failure cohort

**Best Practice Approach:**
1. Use balanced scorecard (Financial, Operational, CX, Risk/Compliance)
2. Adopt Gartner's 3-part framework (ROE, ROI, ROF)
3. Measure the *process output* not *tool usage* for clean attribution
4. Baseline old workflow → Measure new AI-redesigned workflow

**The Barrier:**
Most companies "layer AI on top" of existing processes → Can't cleanly attribute value
High performers redesign workflow → Clean before/after measurement
