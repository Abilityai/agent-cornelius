## Core Insight

"Bring Your Own AI" (BYOAI) is not a planned strategy but a grassroots rebellion - a direct symptom of the "Crisis of Value" where frustrated business units bypass slow, failing central IT initiatives (95% failure rate) to integrate their own best-of-breed AI solutions. While BYOAI appears innovative, it creates massive downstream problems: AI overlap, unnecessary costs, technical debt, and governance/security/FinOps chaos that ultimately requires the centralized "Govern" layer to control.

## Context & Evidence

**What is BYOAI:**
- Decentralized AI trend where business units bypass central IT
- Marketing buys Jasper, legal experiments with Harvey, sales adopts AI tools independently
- Each department selects "best-of-breed" solutions for their specific needs
- Appears fast and innovative on the surface

**Why BYOAI Happens (The Root Cause):**
1. **Central IT Slowness**: Enterprise-wide AI projects move too slowly
2. **95% Failure Rate**: Top-down initiatives stuck in pilot phases with no value
3. **Business Unit Frustration**: Departments need AI capabilities now, not in 18 months
4. **Empowerment**: Business units have budget authority and vendor relationships
5. **Success Stories**: Seeing peers achieve quick wins with standalone tools

**The BYOAI Paradox:**
- **Short-term Win**: Fast deployment, immediate value for individual teams
- **Long-term Disaster**: Creates organizational chaos without governance

**The Cumulative Costs of Uncontrolled BYOAI:**
1. **AI Overlap**: Multiple departments buying functionally identical tools
2. **Unnecessary Costs**: Redundant subscriptions, lack of volume discounts
3. **Technical Debt**: Incompatible systems that can't be integrated later
4. **Governance Nightmare**: No central visibility into AI usage or data flows
5. **Security Risks**: Unvetted tools processing sensitive company data
6. **FinOps Chaos**: Unpredictable, untracked AI spending across departments

**The Solution:**
BYOAI is a symptom, not the problem. The problem is failed central strategy (95% failure). The solution is building the centralized "Govern" layer (AI Sandwich) that enables safe, coordinated BYOAI within guardrails rather than prohibiting it entirely. Organizations must accept that "AI will come from everywhere" and build governance to manage it, not prevent it.
