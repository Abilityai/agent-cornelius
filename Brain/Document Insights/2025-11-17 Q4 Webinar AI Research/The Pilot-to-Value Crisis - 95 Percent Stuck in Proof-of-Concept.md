## Core Insight

MIT's 2025 research reveals that "a whopping 95% of companies are still struggling with AI" - stuck in Stages 1 & 2 (experimentation and proof-of-concept mode), unable to industrialize or create enterprise value. McKinsey confirms that fewer than 10% of generative AI use cases ever make it past the pilot stage.

## Context & Evidence

MIT's 4-stage maturity model shows:
- Stage 1 (Experiment): 28% of firms
- Stage 2 (Build pilots): 34% of firms
- Stage 3 (Industrialize): 31% of firms
- Stage 4 (Future-ready): Only 7% of firms

The data reveals a massive bottleneck: 62% are stuck in experimentation/pilot mode (Stages 1-2), unable to transition to scaled deployment. BCG's research reinforces this: 60% of companies reap "hardly any material value" from AI investments.

The failure mode is "random acts of AI" and "fragmented initiatives" - uncoordinated bottom-up pilots that demonstrate technical feasibility but never achieve enterprise-scale transformation. This is caused by the Vision Gap (no strategic alignment), Foundation Gap (poor data/tech), and Adoption Gap (people/process resistance).
