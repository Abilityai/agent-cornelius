## Core Insight

GenAI has created a "pilot purgatory" phenomenon where enterprises are trapped in endless experimentation cycles: only 48% of AI pilots reach production (taking 8 months on average), approximately 90% never scale beyond experimentation, and two-thirds of organizations report that 30% or fewer experiments will scale in the next 3-6 months. This represents a massive gap between activity and outcomes.

## Context & Evidence

**Key Statistics:**
- Only 48% of AI pilots make it to production (Gartner, July 2024)
- Average 8 months from prototype to production for successful projects
- Approximately 90% of GenAI pilots will not move to production
- In Asia Pacific: average of 24 GenAI pilots launched, only 3 reached production
- Two-thirds of enterprises have not begun scaling AI enterprise-wide
- 30% of GenAI projects will be abandoned after proof of concept by end of 2025

**Root Causes:**
1. **Organizational Issues**: Fragmented ownership, siloed departments, lack of trust in AI outputs
2. **Technical Gaps**: 83% of healthcare executives piloting GenAI, but fewer than 10% invested in infrastructure for enterprise deployment
3. **Strategic Failures**: Lack of clarity on business objectives, no prioritization, insufficient resourcing

**The Trap Pattern:**
- Organizations pursue 20+ simultaneous experiments
- Resources spread too thin across too many pilots
- No clear ownership or accountability for scaling
- Infrastructure not in place before launching pilots
- "Production-ready" criteria undefined before starting POC
- Failed pilots continue consuming resources instead of being killed quickly

**Expert Commentary:**
> "Many leaders are struggling to move past the pilot stage - stuck in pilot purgatory not due to lack of ambition but lack of clarity." - HFS Research, 2024

**The Escape Path:**
- Focus beats breadth: better to fully resource 3 projects than poorly resource 10
- Establish clear ownership and accountability
- Define "production-ready" criteria before starting POC
- Invest in infrastructure before launching experiments
- Kill failed pilots quickly and reallocate resources

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Pilot purgatory is organizational failure masquerading as technical challenge
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Organizations need people who can ship to production, not just experiment
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - Fear of killing failed pilots slows entire organization
- Related to broader pattern of experimentation theater vs. actual execution
