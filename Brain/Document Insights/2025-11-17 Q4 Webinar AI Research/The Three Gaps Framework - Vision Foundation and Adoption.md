## Core Insight

The "Three Gaps" framework (Vision Gap, Foundation Gap, Adoption Gap) is validated by 2024-2025 research as accurately simplifying what major consulting firms charge millions to assess. All six major frameworks (McKinsey, Gartner, Deloitte, BCG, MIT, Stanford) measure the same five universal pillars, which map directly to these three primary failure modes.

## Context & Evidence

**The Three Gaps map 1:1 to industry consensus:**

**Vision Gap → Strategy Pillar**
- Failure mode: "Random acts of AI," "fragmented initiatives," "unclear use cases"
- BCG finding: 5% of future-built firms distinguished by "strong leadership and clear vision"
- This is the absence of top-down strategic alignment on why AI is deployed and what value it creates

**Foundation Gap → Data/Technology Pillar**
- Failure mode: "Building on sand," data quality issues, legacy system integration problems
- Gartner: "Data Availability and Quality" is top implementation challenge
- Deloitte: "Integration with legacy systems" is primary barrier to agentic AI
- MIT: Employees' "second job is cleaning up data"

**Adoption Gap → People/Process/Culture Pillar (The 70% Problem)**
- Failure mode: The most critical and most-overlooked gap
- BCG's 10-20-70 Rule: 70% of success is people, processes, cultural transformation
- BCG's "Frontline adoption gap" and "silicon ceiling"
- MIT: "Transformation happens between your ears"
- Gartner: "Trust is the key differentiator" (57% in high-maturity vs 14% in low)

**Strategic Positioning:**
The Three Gaps framework serves as an executive dashboard that tracks the three primary failure modes that complex multi-million-dollar assessment models are designed to find. It's actionable simplification of consensus, not competing theory.
