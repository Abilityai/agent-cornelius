## Core Insight

AI systems fail from trust imbalances in both directions: insufficient trust hampers adoption (users won't engage), while excessive trust creates risk (users uncritically accept agent actions). Gartner research shows trust is the key differentiator - 57% in high-maturity firms versus only 14% in low-maturity organizations.

## Context & Evidence

McKinsey's framework uniquely warns of the bidirectional trust problem, particularly for agentic AI:
- **Insufficient Trust**: Users avoid the system, preventing adoption and value capture
- **Excessive Trust**: Users blindly accept outputs/actions without verification, creating operational risk

Gartner's data quantifies this: "Trust is one of the differentiators between success and failure for an AI or GenAI initiative." The 4x trust gap between high and low maturity organizations (57% vs 14%) directly predicts adoption success.

The challenge is calibrating trust appropriately - building enough confidence to drive usage while maintaining healthy skepticism that prevents uncritical acceptance. This requires transparency, explainability, and "human-in-the-loop" verification processes.

- [[The 10-20-70 Rule - AI Success is 70 Percent People and Process]] - Trust is a people/culture issue, not technical
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - Trust requires psychological safety to question AI
- Related to: Confirmation bias and dopamine - we want to trust systems that confirm our beliefs
