## Core Insight

Quick wins are not just about financial ROI - they are about building organizational ROI. A quick win functions as a low-risk "flight simulator" for the organization, teaching cross-functional teams HOW to evaluate, procure, integrate, and deploy AI solutions. It builds AI literacy in the end-user base, transforming fear into familiarity, and generates political capital through "internal success stories" used to drive broader buy-in from skeptical units.

## Context & Evidence

The document notes that IT and customer-facing units (Sales, Marketing) serve as "beachheads" for AI. Their internal success stories are the critical tool for driving broader buy-in from slower-adopting units like HR, Legal, or core Operations. The quick win builds organizational muscle memory for AI deployment.

Dual value: Financial returns + organizational capability development + political capital accumulation.
