## Core Insight

RAND Corporation's 2024 study found that 84% of AI project failures are leadership-driven, not due to technical limitations. This directly contradicts the common assumption that AI fails because the technology isn't ready. The technology works—leadership doesn't.

## Context & Evidence

**Breakdown of implementation challenges** (BCG 2024):
- 70% - People and process-related issues
- 20% - Technology problems
- 10% - AI algorithms

**Leadership-specific failures**:
- Misaligned leadership: No clear ownership or mandate for AI transformation
- Lack of strategic clarity: Only 39% of organizations have a strategy for AI use in 2024 (down from 59% in 2020)
- Executive knowledge gap: Only 44% of CEOs believe their CIOs are AI-savvy enough
- Change management neglect: Only 1/3 of companies prioritize change management and training
- Short-term thinking: Focus on "low-hanging fruit" vs. sustainable transformation

**The paradox**: Technical capability advancing rapidly while organizational capability declining. Strategic clarity dropped 20 percentage points (59% → 39%) while AI adoption soared (55% → 78%).

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical - attachment to mental models]] - The 84% leadership failure rate validates that technical capability isn't the bottleneck; psychological and organizational barriers are
- [[AI agents struggle with prototype to production transition]] - Production transition failure is organizational (84%) not technical (16%)
- [[Confirmation bias shapes AI agent evaluation just like human relationships]] - Leadership's inability to objectively evaluate AI compounds the strategic clarity gap

**Related concepts**:
- Change management as core competency
- Strategic clarity vs. tactical experimentation
- Executive education gap
- Organizational readiness vs. technical readiness
