## Core Insight

Time-to-First-Value (TTFV) has become the new critical metric for 2025 AI solutions, replacing traditional project completion milestones. The benchmark: less than 1-2 weeks for a user to achieve a tangible, valuable outcome. This means the "pilot" phase is now simply the first month of production use, not a separate 6-12 month evaluation period. Success is measured in weeks, not quarters.

## Context & Evidence

The document shows radical timeline compression: Setup and onboarding (less than 2 weeks), TTFV for small teams (less than 1 week), TTFV for enterprise features (less than 2 weeks). Example: Dexory's warehouse intelligence system is "up and running in less than 2 weeks" with immediate value. Writer platform showed 85% reduction in review times during the first month "pilot."

The shift: From "let's test this for 6 months" to "does this work in week 1?" This compression reflects the hostile funding environment where solutions must prove value immediately or die.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - TTFV metric prioritizes speed over extensive validation
- [[Uncertain Cue gives a higher Dopamine reward than certain one]] - Fast TTFV resolves uncertainty quickly, reducing anxiety
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Builders ship fast and learn, coders perfect slowly
- Could connect to: Lean startup methodology, rapid iteration
- Could connect to: Customer success metrics, activation rates
- Could connect to: Agile development, sprint cycles
