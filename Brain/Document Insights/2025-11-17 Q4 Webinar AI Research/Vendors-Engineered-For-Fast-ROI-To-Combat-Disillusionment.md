## Core Insight

The consistency of sub-6-month payback periods across disparate industries (logistics, software, finance) is highly significant and reveals a definitive market trend: vendors are being FORCED to combat the "disillusionment phase" by engineering their solutions for rapid, demonstrable ROI. They understand enterprises, having been burned by failed pilots, will no longer fund multi-year R&D projects. They must prove value fast to secure the "buy" decision.

## Context & Evidence

Forrester validated sub-6-month payback for Dexory (warehouse robotics), OutSystems (LCNC), and Writer (GenAI). This consistency across domains proves vendors adapted to hostile funding environment. This has created clear market bifurcation: "Build" projects remain high-risk, multi-year, 80% failure rate. "Buy" projects have become low-risk, sub-6-month ROI, OPEX commodities.

Market evolution: Vendor survival now depends on customer success speed. This aligns incentives - vendors can't afford to sell solutions that take years to prove value.
