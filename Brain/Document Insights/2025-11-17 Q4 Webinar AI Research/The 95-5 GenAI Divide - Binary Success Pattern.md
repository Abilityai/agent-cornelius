## Core Insight

The 2025 enterprise AI landscape exhibits a stark binary outcome: 95% of organizations achieve zero measurable ROI from GenAI initiatives, while only 5% extract millions in value. This is not a normal distribution but a winner-take-all pattern where median ROI is effectively 0% or negative.

## Context & Evidence

**The Data:**
- 95% of organizations getting zero ROI (MLQ.ai State of AI 2025)
- 72% of organizations breaking even or losing money (Gartner CIO survey May 2025)
- 96% of executives report no significant AI ROI (Atlassian 2025)
- McKinsey identifies elite 6% as "AI high performers" who attribute 5%+ of EBIT to AI

**The Implication:**
This is not a maturity curve where everyone gradually improves. It's a chasm - you either cross it or you don't. "Good ROI" in 2025 doesn't mean beating average; it means escaping the 95% failure cohort entirely.

**Market Shift:**
2024 = "Year of Hype" (experimentation, optimism)
2025 = "Year of Reckoning" (demand for measurable results, CEO dissatisfaction)
