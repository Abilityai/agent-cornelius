## Core Insight

"Fundamentally redesigning workflows" is THE operational differentiator between McKinsey's 6% High Performers and the 95% majority. High Performers don't insert AI into existing processes ("AI-Assisted"); they rebuild processes around AI's strengths and weaknesses ("AI-Centric"). This is not about technology deployment—it's about process transformation. The 95% treat AI as a point solution; the 6% treat it as a catalyst for reinvention.

## Context & Evidence

**The McKinsey Finding**:
- 6% High Performers: "Fundamentally redesign workflows" (McKinsey 2025)
- Forrester: High performers "embrace process reinvention"
- This is explicitly called out as THE operational difference

**AI-Assisted vs AI-Centric**:

**AI-Assisted (95% approach)**:
- Insert AI into existing workflow
- Old process: Human writes code → Human reviews
- New process: AI writes code → Human reviews (same process, AI slot-in)
- Result: Productivity Paradox (individual faster, org flat)

**AI-Centric (6% approach)**:
- Redesign entire workflow around AI
- Ask: "If AI can generate code instantly, how should the SDLC work?"
- Redesign review process, planning process, testing process
- Build for AI strengths (speed, consistency) AND weaknesses (hallucination)
- Result: System-level transformation

**The Bain Example (Failure to Redesign)**:
- 75% of engineers use AI coding tools
- +98% more pull requests generated
- +91% increase in review time (bottleneck created)
- +0% improvement in company throughput
- **Why**: Optimized 25-35% of workflow (coding), ignored 65-75% (review)
- **Missed**: Didn't redesign the REVIEW process for AI-generated volume

**What Redesign Looks Like**:
1. **Map entire process**: Identify all steps (not just AI-optimized ones)
2. **Identify bottlenecks**: Where will output pile up?
3. **Redesign bottleneck steps**: How do we handle 98% more PRs?
4. **Build validation in**: Don't add verification as afterthought
5. **Define new roles**: What do humans do now?
6. **Test full system**: Does org throughput improve?

**The Cost of Not Redesigning**:
- Verification Tax kicks in (gains evaporate)
- Bottlenecks emerge (review queue)
- Quality degrades (overwhelmed reviewers)
- Trust destroyed (errors slip through)
- Organizational throughput = unchanged

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The AI Productivity Paradox - individual speed up organizational throughput flat]] - The paradox EXISTS because of failure to redesign workflows; point solution thinking
- [[The Verification Tax - hidden cost that evaporates AI productivity gains]] - Verification Tax is consequence of inserting AI without redesigning validation process
- [[Context engineering replaces prompt engineering - agent success is system design]] - Workflow redesign IS context engineering at organizational level
- [[CEO-level governance most correlated with AI success]] - CEO authority required to mandate cross-functional workflow redesign
- [[Trust as 4x organizational multiplier - 57 percent vs 14 percent differential]] - Trust built through reliable workflows; redesign includes validation processes
- **Systems Thinking** - Must see workflow as interconnected system, not collection of tasks
- **Reengineering** (Hammer & Champy) - Business process reengineering for AI era
- **Theory of Constraints** - Optimize the bottleneck, not the non-bottleneck step
