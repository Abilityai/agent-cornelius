## Core Insight

Best-practice Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) for AI establish a hard liability line: AI is explicitly prohibited from performing tasks that require licensed professionals (legal advice, medical diagnosis, financial guidance) without appropriate human review. This prevents organizations from being held liable for unlicensed AI-generated professional judgment.

## Context & Evidence

**The Pattern Across Leaders:**

**Salesforce (August 2025 AUP):**
- Prohibits use for "individualized legal, financial, or medical advice" without licensed professional review
- Bans automated decisions on employment, housing, credit, or benefits

**OpenAI (2025 Usage Policies):**
- Bars advice "that should come from a certified or qualified professional" including legal, medical, financial
- Also prohibits weapons development, illicit activities, real money gambling

**Anthropic (Claude AUP):**
- Prohibits "provision of tailored advice that requires a license, such as legal or medical advice" without human review
- Clear liability boundary

**The Legal Logic:**
If AI provides unlicensed professional advice and someone acts on it with harmful consequences, the organization could face:
- Professional practice violations (unauthorized practice of law/medicine)
- Product liability claims
- Regulatory enforcement
- Malpractice-equivalent exposure

**The Human-in-the-Loop Requirement:**
AUPs don't ban AI use in these domains entirely - they require licensed professional review before delivery. AI can assist but cannot BE the professional.
