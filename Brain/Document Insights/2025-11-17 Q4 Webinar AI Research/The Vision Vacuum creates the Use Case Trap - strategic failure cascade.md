## Core Insight

The "Vision Vacuum" at the C-suite level directly creates the "Use Case Trap" - a cascade where the absence of strategic AI direction gets filled by bottom-up tactical funding of disconnected, high-cost PoCs ($5M-$20M each) that inevitably get abandoned when executives become "impatient for returns" because no clear business value was defined from the start.

## Context & Evidence

**The Vision Vacuum (Root Cause)**:
- Forrester 2025: "Most organizations lack a compelling vision of what AI means for their specific business context"
- McKinsey: "The barrier is not employees—who are ready—but leaders, who are not steering fast enough"
- Manifests as inability to answer: How will AI reimagine our business model, value proposition, and operations?

**The Use Case Trap (Consequence)**:
- In absence of strategic "North Star," organizations "drown in discussions about individual AI 'use cases' and 'agents' while missing the bigger transformation story" (Forrester)
- Creates illusion of progress through funding dozens/hundreds of disconnected PoCs
- Each GenAI PoC costs $5M-$20M (Gartner data)
- Result: 30% PoC abandonment rate (Gartner 2025) + 42% strategic abandonment (up 2.5x from 17% in 2024, S&P Global)

**The Cascade Mechanism**:
1. No C-suite vision → No strategic filter for projects
2. Bottom-up PoC requests approved based on hype, not alignment
3. Projects funded without "clear business value" definition
4. Executives grow "impatient to see returns" (but returns were never defined)
5. Strategically-untethered projects cut first → Massive abandonment

**The Sunk Cost**:
- $5M-$20M per abandoned PoC × 30-42% abandonment rate = Tens of millions wasted per enterprise
- 2.5x increase in abandonment (2024→2025) despite AI models *improving* → This is strategic failure, not technical

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical - attachment to mental models]] - The Vision Vacuum stems from leadership attachment to old business models; can't envision AI future because mentally anchored to "how business should work"
- [[Companies want builders not coders - AI shifts the skill demand]] - Leaders lack builders; they have coders tackling use cases without seeing system transformation
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - Vision Vacuum = opposite of safety; creates fear-based tactical behavior instead of bold strategic bets
- **Strategic vs Tactical Thinking** - Classic failure to distinguish strategy (where we're going) from tactics (what we're doing today)
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy** - Organizations funding PoCs based on previous investment, not strategic fit
- **Analysis Paralysis** - Absence of vision creates proliferation of options → decision gridlock
