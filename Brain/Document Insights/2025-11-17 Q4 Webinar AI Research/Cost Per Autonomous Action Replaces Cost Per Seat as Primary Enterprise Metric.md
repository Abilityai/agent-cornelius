## Core Insight

Enterprise software pricing is shifting from "cost-per-seat" (human user licenses) to "cost-per-autonomous-action" (digital labor consumption). This new metric directly measures the cost of digital labor, aligning payment with value delivered rather than potential users. Salesforce has benchmarked this at $0.10 per autonomous action.

## Context & Evidence

**The Old Metric: Cost Per Seat**
- Pay per human user who can access the system
- Whether they use it or not, cost is fixed
- Measures access, not value
- Example: $50/user/month × 100 users = $5,000/month

**The New Metric: Cost Per Autonomous Action**
- Pay per completed autonomous task
- Only pay when agent delivers value
- Directly measures digital labor output
- Example: $0.10 × 10,000 actions = $1,000/month

**Why This Shift Matters:**
- Aligns cost directly with business value
- Makes ROI transparent and measurable
- Encourages high-volume agent utilization
- Shifts from "who has access?" to "what gets done?"

**Production Pricing Examples:**
- **Salesforce Agentforce**: $0.10 per autonomous action OR $125-$150/user/month
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio**: $0.01 per Copilot Credit (unit of computational effort)
- **ServiceNow**: Hybrid model with AI add-on fees

**The Strategic Implication:**
Consumption pricing makes agents economically attractive for high-volume, low-complexity tasks. A human support agent costs $3,000-5,000/month. An AI agent handling 10,000 actions costs $1,000.

**The Measurement Challenge:**
What constitutes an "action"? Industry needs standards:
- Full issue resolution? (Salesforce approach)
- API call? (Too granular)
- Customer interaction? (Too broad)

**The Transparency Benefit:**
With consumption pricing, you can directly calculate: "This agent resolved 5,000 customer issues this month at $500 total cost ($0.10 each). A human team would cost $15,000 for same volume."
