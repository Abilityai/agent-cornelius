## Core Insight

The 2025 quick win represents a fundamental shift in what "success" means: it's a procurement and integration success, not an R&D breakthrough. Organizations achieving documented sub-6-month ROI are not building their own LLMs - they are licensing platforms from vendors who have already invested in domain-specific expertise. The "buy vs. build" decision is the primary enabler of speed.

## Context & Evidence

The data shows that attempting to "build" foundational AI models is a "distraction for the average enterprise customer." The quick win is about vendor evaluation, API-first integration, and rapid deployment of mature, packaged alternatives. This bypasses the immense cost, complexity, and high failure rate (80%) of internal "build" projects.

Critical strategic shift: Success is no longer measured by technical innovation but by procurement wisdom and integration competence.
