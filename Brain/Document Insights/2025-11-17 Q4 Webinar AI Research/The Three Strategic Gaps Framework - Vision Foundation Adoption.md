## Core Insight

AI project failures (80-95% rate) cluster into three distinct strategic gaps that represent industry consensus: Vision Gap (random acts of AI without strategy), Foundation Gap (poor data quality as liability), and Adoption Gap (people vs. tech resistance). Critically, these gaps are NOT independent - they cascade and reinforce each other in a failure pattern.

## Context & Evidence

**Validation from leading firms:**
- McKinsey's six dimensions map to: Strategy (Vision), Data (Foundation), Adoption & Scaling (Adoption)
- BCG's five success factors cluster similarly: Strategic alignment/Focus/Centralized steering (Vision), Value structures (Foundation), Process redesign (Adoption)
- Gartner, Deloitte, MIT CDOIQ, RAND all independently arrive at same three failure categories

**Relative weight of gaps:**
- Foundation Gap: 40-50% of failures (70%+ linked to data problems, most frequently cited)
- Adoption Gap: 30-40% of failures (74% struggle to scale, critical for deployed projects)
- Vision Gap: 20-30% of failures (upstream enabler that amplifies other gaps)

**Critical cascade pattern:**
1. Vision Gap enables Foundation Gap (no strategy → poor data prioritization, 57% of CDOs haven't updated data strategy for AI)
2. Foundation Gap enables Adoption Gap (poor model performance from bad data → user trust collapses)
3. Vision Gap directly impacts Adoption Gap (no strategic mandate → insufficient change management resources)

**Reinforcing failure loop:**
Early adoption failures due to lack of change management confirm skeptics' views → "we tried AI and it didn't work" becomes organizational narrative → harder to build strategic case → organization retreats to random acts of AI

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Adoption Gap is fundamentally about human factors
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Strategic thinking more valuable than technical implementation
- [[Professional identity creates AI resistance]] - Connects to why middle managers show greatest resistance in Adoption Gap
- [[Context engineering replaces prompt engineering]] - Vision Gap about strategic context, not technical prompting
