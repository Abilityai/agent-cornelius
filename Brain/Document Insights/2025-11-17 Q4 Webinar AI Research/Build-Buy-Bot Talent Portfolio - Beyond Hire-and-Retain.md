## Core Insight

AI leaders use a sophisticated three-part talent strategy: **Build-Buy-Bot**. (1) BUILD skills-based capabilities for 80% of workforce through 2x training investment; (2) BUY elite talent for 1-3 year "tours of duty" then ACCEPT their departure as successful knowledge transfer, not retention failure; (3) BOT by "hiring" AI agents to augment capacity. This contrasts with laggards who are paralyzed - unable to afford elite talent ($500k+ salaries) and unwilling to invest in building internal capabilities (60% expect upskilling but provide no training).

## Context & Evidence

**The Build Strategy (Default - 80% of Workforce):**
- 2x more training investment than laggards (59% get 5+ hours vs. 36%)
- Skills-based approach: Deconstruct jobs into tasks, identify what AI can do, upskill humans for higher-value work
- Organizationally embedded: ServiceNow/Moderna created "Chief Human and AI Resources Officer" role to fuse HR and AI deployment at C-suite

**The Buy Strategy (Strategic - 5% Elite Talent):**
- Hire expensive AI talent ($500k+) for FIXED 1-3 year "tour of duty"
- Pay exceptionally well to solve specific hard problem (e.g., build AI Factory)
- ACCEPT subsequent departure to tech giants as planned knowledge transfer
- Laggards try "buy and retain" (fails); leaders do "buy and extract value" (succeeds)

**The Bot Strategy (New - 15% of Tasks):**
- "Hiring" AI agents as digital workers to expand capacity
- Redefines management from "overseeing people" to "orchestrating blended systems of people and agents" (McKinsey)
- Third pillar of talent portfolio, not just automation

**The Laggard Paralysis:**
- 60% expect employees to upskill but provide NO guidance
- Only 25% of workers receive ANY AI training
- Can't afford elite talent, won't invest in building it
- Result: Permanent capability gap
