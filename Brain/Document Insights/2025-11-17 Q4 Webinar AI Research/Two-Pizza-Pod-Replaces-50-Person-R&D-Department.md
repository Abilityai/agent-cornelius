## Core Insight

The 80% project failure rate is a powerful indictment of the old, siloed IT project model. Successful quick wins are not run by 50-person R&D departments but by small, cross-functional "two-pizza pod" teams (Business Owner, IT/Integration Lead, End-User Champion). This business-led, IT-supported model ensures projects remain focused on solving business problems, not pursuing technology for its own sake.

## Context & Evidence

The three key roles: (1) Business Owner - P&L leader whose KPIs improve, owns the outcome, (2) IT/Integration Lead - manages APIs, security, connectivity, (3) End-User Champion(s) - actual users providing feedback for adoption. This structure inverts the traditional IT-led model where business stakeholders are "consulted."

The shift: From IT delivering technology to Business solving problems with IT enabling them. Ownership moves from technologists to outcome owners.
