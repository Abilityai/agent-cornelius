## Core Insight

Counterintuitively, AI winners focus on FEWER use cases than losers. Leaders average 3.5 use cases with deep integration while laggards scatter efforts across 6.1 pilots. This "depth over breadth" pattern directly contradicts the common assumption that more AI projects = more value.

## Context & Evidence

**BCG 2025 Survey Finding**:
- Leading companies (5% of winners): Average 3.5 use cases
- Lagging companies (95% failures): Average 6.1 use cases
- Laggards explicitly described as "diluting their efforts by placing too many AI bets"

**Why Depth Wins**:
Agentic AI requires deep, complex integration with existing systems. A "mile wide, inch deep" approach results in numerous superficial pilots that never leave the lab. A "mile deep, inch wide" approach produces fully-productionized workflows (like atmira's debt collection agent or Lumen's sales agent) that generate real P&L impact.

**The Integration Complexity Factor**:
- Each agentic use case requires: workflow redesign, platform integration, data access, permission management, governance frameworks, C-suite sponsorship
- Spreading resources across 6+ pilots means none get the depth needed to cross from pilot to production
- 3.5 focused use cases allows full investment in each workflow transformation

**Real-World Example**:
- atmira built ONE pure vertical agent (debt collection) - achieved 30-40% recovery rate increase and 54% cost reduction
- Contrast with the 42% of abandoned projects that tried to do too much at once

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The GenAI Divide - 95 Percent Failure Pattern]] - Breadth is a failure pattern characteristic
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Leaders overcome resistance by proving value deeply in one area first
- [[Workflow redesign versus bolt-on strategy]] - Depth enables true redesign; breadth forces bolt-on approach
- [[Focus beats diversification in high-uncertainty domains]] - Similar to startup focus vs corporate scattered innovation
