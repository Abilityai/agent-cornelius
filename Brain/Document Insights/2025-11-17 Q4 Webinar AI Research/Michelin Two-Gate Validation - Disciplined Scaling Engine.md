## Core Insight

Michelin's "scaling engine" uses a disciplined two-gate validation process that gives executives confidence to fund projects THROUGH the productivity J-Curve: **(1) Identify and quantify potential value at proof-of-concept stage** (the "Go" decision); **(2) Deploy pilot, manage J-Curve friction, then conduct post-deployment assessment of actual value delivered** (the "Scale" decision). This rigorous process allowed Michelin to scale 200+ use cases generating **€50 million in annual ROI**, growing 30-40% annually. It's the blueprint for escaping "pilot purgatory."

## Context & Evidence

**The Two-Gate Process:**
- **Gate 1 (Pre-Deployment)**: Quantify POTENTIAL value at PoC stage
  - Business case with financial projections
  - Clear success criteria established
  - Executive commitment secured for J-Curve period

- **Gate 2 (Post-Deployment)**: Assess ACTUAL value delivered
  - Measure against Gate 1 projections
  - Validate J-Curve was managed successfully
  - Make scale/kill/iterate decision based on real results

**Why This Works:**
- Gives executives financial confidence to invest through temporary productivity dip
- Prevents "panic abandonment" when metrics temporarily decline
- Creates institutional knowledge: "We've done this 200 times, we know the pattern"
- Provides data to improve future estimates (learning loop)

**Michelin's Results:**
- 200+ use cases scaled (not just piloted)
- €50 million annual ROI
- 30-40% annual growth in AI-driven value
- Validated model that non-tech companies can replicate

**Strategic Implication:**
This process is THE answer to the 95% failure rate. It's not that projects fail technically - it's that organizations kill them during the J-Curve dip before value can materialize. The two-gate process institutionalizes patience and discipline through structured financial validation.

**Contrast with Laggards:**
- Laggards: Greenlight pilots expecting immediate ROI → hit J-Curve → panic → kill project → repeat
- Leaders: Quantify value upfront → deploy with eyes open → manage dip → validate results → scale winners
