## Core Insight

The 2023-era "pilot-first" model has proven to be a failure, directly causing 95% of firms to be "stuck in proof-of-concept mode." The 2025 consensus from all major consulting firms is "assessment-first" - resist the urge to start with pilots and instead invest in strategic assessment to identify and close gaps before committing to technology.

## Context & Evidence

All major frameworks now explicitly recommend assessment before pilots:
- **McKinsey**: CEO Playbook's first action is "conclude the experimentation phase and realign AI priorities"
- **Deloitte**: Recommends "candid assessment" of organizational challenges as the first step
- **Gartner**: Roadmap begins with "Assess data management readiness"
- **BCG**: "FAST" framework is a comprehensive assessment model designed to evaluate readiness before deployment

This represents a fundamental shift in strategy. The pilot-first approach led to "random acts of AI" and "fragmented initiatives" that never scaled. McKinsey finds fewer than 10% of generative AI pilots ever create value. MIT research shows 95% of companies are "struggling" precisely because they jumped to experiments without understanding their gaps.

The implication: First investment should be rapid strategic assessment to identify Vision Gap, Foundation Gap, and Adoption Gap before spending on technology.
