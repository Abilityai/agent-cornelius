## Core Insight

The "data problem"—60% of AI projects abandoned due to "lack of AI-ready data"—is not a technical failure but the final, visible symptom of strategic failure. The project "fails" at the data level because the organization cannot define "fit-for-purpose" data, which is impossible in a "Vision Vacuum." The cost/risk of data preparation is unjustifiable precisely because no "clear business value" was defined from the start.

## Context & Evidence

**The Traditional Framing (Wrong)**:
- Legacy claim: 85% of AI projects fail due to "poor data quality"
- Implication: If we just had better data, AI would work
- Treats data as THE root cause

**The 2025 Reframing (Correct)**:
- "AI-ready" ≠ just "high-quality" (clean, complete)
- "AI-ready" = **"fit for purpose"** (relevant, permissioned, contextualized, aligned with business objective)
- Key insight: You can't define "fit for purpose" without defining PURPOSE

**The Cascade**:
1. **Strategic Failure**: Vision Vacuum → No clear AI strategy
2. **Operational Failure**: No workflow redesign → Can't define new process
3. **Foundational Failure**: Can't define "fit-for-purpose" data → Project stalls at data prep

**The Data Becomes the Scapegoat**:
- Team goes to find/prepare data
- Discovers they can't define what they need (no clear purpose)
- Discovers cost/risk of data prep is high (30-50% of time on compliance)
- Can't justify the cost because project has no "clear business value"
- Project abandoned and blamed on "data readiness"

**The Evidence**:
- Gartner: 60% abandoned for "lack of AI-ready data"
- Same Gartner: 30% PoC abandoned for "unclear business value"
- McKinsey: "Risk and cost choke off scale" (can't justify investment)
- Connection: Data cost unjustifiable BECAUSE value undefined

**The Real Pattern**:
- Strategic failure (no vision) → Operational failure (no workflow) → Foundational failure (no data)
- Data problem is **last domino to fall** but **first to be blamed**

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The Vision Vacuum creates the Use Case Trap - strategic failure cascade]] - Data problem is the THIRD domino in the cascade; Vision Vacuum is root
- [[The AI Productivity Paradox - individual speed up organizational throughput flat]] - Can't define "fit-for-purpose" workflow without redesigning workflow first
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical - attachment to mental models]] - Blaming "data problem" is psychological defense; easier to blame technical issue than admit strategic failure
- **Root Cause Analysis** - Classic misidentification of symptom (data) as cause (strategy)
- **Scapegoating Pattern** - Technical issues blamed when real problem is organizational/leadership
- **Sunk Cost Justification** - Can't justify data investment when project value was never defined
