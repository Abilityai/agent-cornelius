## Core Insight

Gartner's "AI Sandwich" framework provides the essential architectural model for executing a "Blend" strategy through three interdependent layers: Run (decentralized experiments), Govern (centralized trust/control), and Build (centralized infrastructure). The critical insight is that without building the "Govern" middle layer, the chaos of decentralized AI adoption leads to runaway costs, compliance disasters, and technical debt, making the governance layer non-negotiable for any organization with 10+ AI projects.

## Context & Evidence

**The Three-Layer Architecture:**

1. **Top Layer: "Run" (Decentralized)**
   - Where AI meets the business
   - Department-led experiments and "BYOAI" (Bring Your Own AI) tools
   - Fast, innovative, and chaotic
   - Marketing buys Jasper, legal experiments with Harvey, etc.

2. **Middle Layer: "Govern" (Centralized) - THE CRITICAL LAYER**
   - The essential "trust layer" that manages chaos from Run layer
   - Centralized AI governance function powered by TRiSM (Trust, Risk, and Security Management)
   - For organizations with >10 AI projects, human governance is too slow
   - TRiSM tools required to mechanize and enforce AI policies in real-time
   - Controls costs, ensures compliance, prevents technical debt

3. **Bottom Layer: "Build" (Centralized)**
   - Foundational infrastructure managed by IT
   - MLOps pipelines, data architecture, compute resources
   - Provides stable, secure foundation for deployment

**Why the Govern Layer is Non-Negotiable:**

Without the centralized "Govern" layer:
- The "Run" layer (BYOAI) creates "AI overlap, unnecessary costs, and technical debt"
- Uncoordinated tool adoption leads to governance, security, and FinOps chaos
- 95% failure rate of ungoverned AI initiatives
- Inability to manage the "Blend" portfolio effectively

**The Strategic Imperative:**
A successful 2025 strategy MUST build the "Govern" layer. It is the only way to manage a "Blend" portfolio, control the "BYOAI" chaos, and ensure all AI projects (whether Built, Bought, or Partnered) are secure, compliant, ethical, and financially viable. This is the universal, non-negotiable capability regardless of chosen implementation path.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- **Related to**: Organizational architecture, governance frameworks, managing chaos
- **Contrasts With**: Pure top-down or pure bottom-up AI strategies
- **Builds On**: Recognition that both centralization and decentralization are necessary
- **Enables**: Safe, scalable "Blend" strategy execution, controlling BYOAI proliferation
