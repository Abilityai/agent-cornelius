## Core Insight

The expected payback period for successful AI projects has compressed from 12-18 months to 6-12 months in 2025. Projects that don't show measurable value within 12 months are not "long-term investments" - they are failed projects destined for the 95% failure cohort.

## Context & Evidence

**The New Reality:**
- 74% of executives at AI-deploying organizations report ROI within first year (Google Cloud 2025)
- McKinsey-MIT: Payback window has *shrunk* for both leaders and laggards
- Forrester: Process automation projects achieve <6 month payback (Microsoft Power Automate study)

**Binary Outcome:**
The market is characterized by fast success or fast failure, not long-term payback:
- 30% of GenAI projects abandoned after PoC stage (Gartner prediction, end of 2025)
- 40%+ of agentic AI projects will be canceled by end of 2027 (Gartner)

**The Exception:**
Only massive-scale foundational infrastructure ("AI factories") operate on 10-year payback cycles - these are not relevant to typical enterprise deployments.

**Strategic Implication:**
This creates extreme urgency for:
1. Selecting the right initial use case
2. Choosing implementation partner who can guarantee path to value within 12-month window
3. Avoiding "pilot purgatory" and science projects
