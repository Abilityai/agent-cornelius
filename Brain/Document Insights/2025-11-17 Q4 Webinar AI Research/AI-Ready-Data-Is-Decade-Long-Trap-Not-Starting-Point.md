## Core Insight

Gartner's 2025 Hype Cycle explicitly warns that "AI-ready data" is NOT a quick win but sits at the "Peak of Inflated Expectations" - achieving this state could take up to a decade. Starting a "data readiness" project guarantees a multi-year, high-cost initiative with no short-term ROI. It is the functional opposite of a quick win and the #1 trap killing AI projects in 2025.

## Context & Evidence

The correct 2025 strategy is to bypass this trap entirely by starting with "buy" solutions that solve narrow business problems with minimal data requirements (e.g., a contact center bot that only needs to connect to the order-status API). Use cost savings from that first win to fund targeted data cleanup only for the next specific use case - an iterative, self-funding approach rather than "boiling the data ocean."

The antidote: Connectivity over purity. APIs over data lakes. Narrow scope over comprehensive transformation.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - The "clean data first" belief provides false certainty
- [[Pattern completion creates illusion of coherent self]] - Organizations complete the pattern "first prepare, then execute" even when harmful
- Could connect to: Perfectionism as procrastination, analysis paralysis
- Could connect to: 80/20 principle, sufficient vs. perfect data
- Could connect to: Iterative development, agile vs. waterfall
