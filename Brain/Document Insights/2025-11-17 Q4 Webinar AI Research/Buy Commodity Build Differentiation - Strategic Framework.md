## Core Insight

The consensus 2025 build-vs-buy framework is: **"Buy commodity capabilities, build only for differentiation."** Leaders BUY off-the-shelf AI for standard functions (HR, finance, marketing automation) to gain 5-7 months speed-to-market. They BUILD custom AI only for core strategic processes that create competitive moats (e.g., Michelin's quality control, United's decision velocity tools). Laggards get trapped comparing monthly subscription prices to build costs, missing that vendor lock-in affects 80%+ of buyers and switching costs are often 2x the initial investment.

## Context & Evidence

**The Strategic Split:**
- **BUY**: Commodity functions (standard business processes)
  - Advantage: 5-7 months faster deployment
  - Risk: Vendor lock-in (80%+ of buyers), 2x switching costs

- **BUILD**: Core differentiating processes (competitive moat)
  - Advantage: Own the IP, competitive control
  - Cost: $100k-$500k+ initial, $5k-$20k/month maintenance, 9-18 month timeline

**The 2025 Model Shift:**
Major shift AWAY from building/fine-tuning models toward "buy and prompt." Advanced prompt engineering with long context windows now achieves better results than fine-tuning, is cheaper, and avoids model lock-in (prompts are portable).

**Leader's Vendor Lock-In Mitigation:**
Leaders don't avoid "buy" - they mitigate risk:
1. Build abstraction layers on top of bought platforms
2. Use open-source frameworks (e.g., LangChain)
3. Standardize on APIs for component swapping
4. Negotiate data export rights upfront
5. 4-pillar vendor evaluation: Technology, Data, People, Performance (with contractual KPIs)

**The TCO Trap:**
Laggards compare $X/month subscription to $500k build cost and think "buy" is cheap. Leaders calculate TOTAL cost of ownership:
- Build TCO: High upfront + talent salaries + maintenance
- Buy TCO: Low upfront + HIGH vendor lock-in + 2x switching cost if you need to change

**Strategic Implication:**
This is not about "always buy" or "always build" - it's about STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT. Ask: "Is this process core to our competitive advantage?" If yes, build and own it. If no, buy for speed and focus internal resources on what matters.
