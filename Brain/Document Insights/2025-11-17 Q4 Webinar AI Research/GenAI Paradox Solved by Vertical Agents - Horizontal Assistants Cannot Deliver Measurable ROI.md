## Core Insight

The "GenAI Paradox" - 80% of companies use GenAI but 80% report no bottom-line impact - is caused by investment in "horizontal" assistive copilots delivering diffuse, unmeasurable productivity gains. Measurable, high-figure ROI (213% ROI, £60M savings) exists exclusively in "vertical" autonomous agents embedded in specific business functions like customer service, IT support, and finance.

## Context & Evidence

**The Paradox:**
- Nearly 80% of companies report using Generative AI
- Equal number (80%) report no significant bottom-line impact
- Root cause: Investment focused on wrong type of AI

**Horizontal Assistants (Low/No ROI):**
- Suggest actions, draft emails, summarize documents
- Deliver diffuse productivity gains across entire workforce
- Hard to measure, attribute, or quantify financial impact
- Examples: General-purpose copilots, writing assistants

**Vertical Agents (High ROI):**
- Autonomously execute end-to-end business processes
- Embedded in specific functions with clear metrics
- Measurable outcomes: resolution rates, cycle times, error reduction
- Examples: Customer service agents (70-85% autonomous resolution), IT support (43-54% autonomous resolution), invoice processing (70% faster cycles)

**Proven ROI Examples:**
- Wiley: 213% ROI, $230,000 annual savings (customer service)
- Aviva: £60M ($82M) annual savings (claims processing)
- ServiceNow: $5.5M annual savings (IT support)

**Key Distinction**: Vertical agents are digital laborers performing measurable work units. Horizontal assistants are productivity enhancers with intangible benefits.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - But ROI bottleneck is strategic (wrong AI type)
- [[Context = Perspective + Information]] - Vertical agents have functional context, horizontal lack it
- [[The Folder Paradigm - Agents own directories as memory]] - Vertical agents need specialized memory structures
