## Core Insight

In an environment with an 80% AI project failure rate (twice that of other IT initiatives), quick wins are not optional "nice-to-have" pilots - they are a critical survival strategy. The quick win is the only rational way to start because any project that looks like a multi-year, complex R&D effort will be seen as a boondoggle and will likely have its funding cut during the "trough of disillusionment."

## Context & Evidence

The document reveals that 2025 marks the full arrival of AI's "disillusionment phase" after a year of widespread experimentation and hype. With 80% of AI projects failing, organizations need tangible, undeniable P&L wins to build momentum and confidence required to survive this trough and continue their AI journey.

The strategic repositioning: Quick wins are not about experimentation - they are about organizational survival in a hostile funding environment where executives have been burned by failed pilots.
