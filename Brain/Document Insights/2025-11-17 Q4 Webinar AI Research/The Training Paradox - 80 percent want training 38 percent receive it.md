## Core Insight

Four in five U.S. employees want more AI training, but only 38% of executives are providing it - creating a massive demand-supply mismatch where organizations deploy AI tools while systematically under-investing in the training that would enable adoption. Meanwhile, 74% of employees explicitly say lack of training holds them back from using AI, and 38% of adoption challenges stem directly from insufficient training.

## Context & Evidence

**The training gap:**
- 80% of employees want more AI training
- Only 38% of executives are currently providing AI literacy training
- 74% of employees say lack of training holds them back from using AI
- 38% of AI adoption challenges stem from insufficient training in AI tools
- Nearly half of executives say people lack AI skills necessary to implement and scale AI

**The ROI evidence for training:**
- AI-trained teams see 20-30% rise in efficiency (Deloitte)
- Nielsen Norman Group reports 66% boost in user performance with generative AI (when properly trained)
- MIT suggests highly skilled workers could see 40% increase in productivity
- Enterprises that integrate change management (including training) are 47% more likely to meet objectives
- Companies investing in building trust through training are nearly 2x more likely to see revenue growth of 10%+

**The paradox mechanism:**
1. Organizations invest millions in AI technology and tools
2. Deploy tools to employees without adequate training
3. Employees struggle to use tools effectively (74% cite training deficit)
4. Adoption rates stay low (23% typical vs. 80%+ with proper training)
5. Executives blame "resistance to change" or "the technology" rather than training deficit
6. Continue pattern with next AI tool

**Why executives under-invest in training:**
- Training seems like cost center vs. technology as value driver
- Pressure to show quick wins drives deployment before enablement
- Middle managers (who should advocate for training) lack commitment due to rational self-interest
- "It's intuitive" fallacy - executives who grasp AI quickly assume employees will too

**The skill gap reality:**
- 57% of organizations identified skill gaps as one of biggest AI challenges
- 48% cited lack of clarity about AI's business impacts (training would address)
- Only 10% of organizations feel completely ready from capability perspective

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Training addresses psychological barriers
- [[The 70-20-10 Rule - AI Leaders Resource Allocation]] - 70% to people includes training
- [[The Trust Disparity Problem - Executive versus Frontline AI Trust]] - Training builds trust
- [[Middle Management Rational Self-Interest as AI Adoption Barrier]] - Training underfunding reflects middle management resistance
