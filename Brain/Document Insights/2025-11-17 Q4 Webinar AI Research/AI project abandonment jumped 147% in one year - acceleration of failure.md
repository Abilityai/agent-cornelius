## Core Insight

The share of companies abandoning most of their AI initiatives jumped from 17% in 2024 to 42% in 2025 - a 147% increase in just one year. We're not just failing to improve; we're getting worse even as adoption soars. This indicates a compounding crisis where early enthusiasm meets implementation reality.

## Context & Evidence

**The abandonment acceleration**:
- 2024: 17% abandoning most AI initiatives
- 2025: 42% abandoning most AI initiatives
- Average POCs scrapped before production: 46%

**Trend analysis** (2022-2025):
- AI adoption: 45% → 55% → 78% → 85% (est) ↗ RISING
- Strategic clarity: 50% → 45% → 39% (declining) ↘ FALLING
- Project abandonment: N/A → N/A → 17% → 42% ↗↗ ACCELERATING

**The paradox**: Simultaneous increase in:
1. Adoption rates (more companies trying AI)
2. Abandonment rates (more companies giving up)
3. Investment ($644B in 2025, up 76.4%)

**What this reveals**:
- Initial enthusiasm ("we need AI!") → Implementation reality ("this doesn't work")
- Board pressure to show ROI → Cannot demonstrate value → Abandon initiatives
- Gap between marketing promises and delivery capability widening
- Organizations stuck in "pilot purgatory" losing patience

**Gartner prediction**: 30% of GenAI projects will be abandoned by end of 2025 due to poor data quality, inadequate risk controls, escalating costs, or unclear business value.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[GenAI has 2x higher failure rate than traditional AI - The GenAI Divide]] - Higher failure rates naturally lead to higher abandonment rates
- [[Less than 20% track GenAI KPIs yet tracking has most impact on results]] - Without metrics, can't prove value → projects get abandoned
- [[84% of AI failures are leadership-driven not technical]] - Leadership losing patience compounds abandonment acceleration
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical - attachment to mental models]] - Abandonment may reflect organizations hitting the psychological barrier and retreating to familiar territory

**Novel pattern**: Technology adoption can have negative second derivative - not just slow progress but accelerating regression.
