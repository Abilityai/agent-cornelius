## Core Insight

The old 2024 governance approach of "banning" AI tools failed catastrophically (93% executive non-compliance). The new 2025 governance principle: "make the safe choice the easy choice" - governance must become an accelerant that enables velocity, not a blocker that drives shadow adoption. McKinsey data shows CEO oversight of AI governance is one of the single biggest correlates with bottom-line EBIT impact.

## Context & Evidence

**Why the old approach failed:**
- 2024: Ban unauthorized tools, create approval workflows
- Result: 93% of executives bypass the rules anyway
- Shadow AI proliferated because safe tools were slower/worse than unsafe ones
- Governance became the bottleneck that people routed around

**The new governance philosophy:**
- "Make the safe choice the easy choice" (American Bar Association)
- Governance teams must "accelerate their risk reviews" not slow them
- "Automate how they detect AI use" so they can move fast
- Goal: "Serve as a driver of innovation" not "chase unsolicited AI use"

**The implementation shift:**
- From blocking to enabling
- From reactive to proactive
- From manual approval to automated detection and guardrails
- From IT-led to CEO-led oversight

**Why CEO-led governance matters:**
- McKinsey: "CEO's oversight of AI governance" is one of the "single biggest correlates" with higher bottom-line impact
- Can't be delegated to compliance or IT
- Needs executive authority to make safe choices actually easy
- Requires removing organizational friction, not just adding policies

**The strategic insight:** If governance creates friction, people route around it (Shadow AI). If governance removes friction while maintaining safety, it becomes competitive advantage. The goal is psychological safety + velocity, not just compliance.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Shadow AI is a top-down leadership failure]] - Result of blocker governance, not enabler governance
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - Safe choice must also be fast choice
- [[Board AI oversight tripled in 2025]] - Boards now demanding this governance approach
- **Contrasts with**: Traditional IT security models focused on blocking and controlling
