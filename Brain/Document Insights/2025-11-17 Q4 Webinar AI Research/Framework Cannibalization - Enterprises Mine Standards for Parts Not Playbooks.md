## Core Insight

Enterprises are not adopting formal AI standards (NIST, ISO) as complete frameworks but actively "cannibalizing" them for parts - extracting process language, risk taxonomies, and common vocabulary while ignoring certification requirements. NIST and ISO serve as foundational "menus" rather than operational playbooks.

---

## Context & Evidence

**The Pattern:**
- NIST AI RMF is not implemented end-to-end; instead, its four-function process (Govern, Map, Measure, Manage) is adopted as common-sense language for risk assessment
- ISO/IEC 42001 is used as a "readiness guide" for key elements (AI policy, responsibilities, risk assessment) without pursuing full certification
- Forrester's AEGIS framework explicitly treats NIST and ISO as "core and backbone" with 100% of its 39 controls mapping to both

**The Standardization Gap:**
Traditional standards development (18-36 month cycles) cannot keep pace with rapid AI evolution, creating a "patchwork of faster but unofficial industry frameworks"

**Why This Matters:**
Organizations need the legitimacy of formal standards (for boards, auditors, regulators) but require the agility of analyst frameworks (Gartner TRiSM, Forrester AEGIS) for actual operations. The solution is strategic extraction rather than wholesale adoption.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Contrasts With]]: Traditional compliance models that require full framework adoption
- [[Builds On]]: Pragmatic approach to governance under rapid technological change
- [[Enables]]: Faster governance implementation without waiting for formal certification
- [[Pattern]]: Similar to how organizations adopt security frameworks (extracting controls vs full compliance)
