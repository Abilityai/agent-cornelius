## Core Insight

The "pilot-to-production gap" (where 88% of AI POCs fail to reach production, 95% of organizations get zero ROI) is not a technical problem but a governance problem. Pilots die because there is no formal "governance bridge" to move them safely into production - no "path-to-yes" from legal, risk, and compliance.

## Context & Evidence

**The Data:**
- Gartner: 30% of AI pilots discontinued at pilot stage (top reasons: poor governance, unclear business value)
- Lenovo/IDC: 88% of AI POCs do not advance to production (one case: 33 POCs launched, only 4 reached production)
- Project NANDA: 95% of organizations get zero return from GenAI investments while 5% "high performers" extract massive value

**The Pattern:**
Companies successfully BUILD pilots (technical success) but pilots DIE because there's no formal process to move them safely into live production environments. Legal, risk, and compliance teams have no framework for approval.

**The False Diagnosis:**
Organizations treat this as a technical scaling problem when it's actually an organizational/governance gap. The 5% of high performers have governance frameworks that provide clear paths to production.

**The Insight:**
"Pilot purgatory" IS the "policy-to-practice gap" in action. Governance is not the brake that stops innovation - it's the bridge that enables production deployment.
