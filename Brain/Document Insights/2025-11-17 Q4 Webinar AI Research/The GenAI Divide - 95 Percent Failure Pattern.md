## Core Insight

95% of enterprise GenAI projects deliver zero measurable ROI, while only 5% achieve massive value (nine-figure savings, triple-digit ROI). This "GenAI Divide" is not determined by AI model quality but by implementation strategy - specifically whether companies treat AI as a bolt-on tool or a catalyst for workflow redesign.

---

## Context & Evidence

**The Stark Statistics (2024-2025)**:
- 95% of GenAI projects show no measurable P&L impact
- 42% of all AI initiatives abandoned before reaching production (up from 17% previous year)
- 90% of "vertical" (transformative) use cases stuck in pilot mode
- After $30-40 billion in corporate investment

**The 5% Winners**:
- ServiceNow: $350M in value from internal AI agents
- Lumen: $50M projected annual savings
- Wiley: 213% ROI, >40% case resolution increase
- atmira: 30-40% increase in debt recovery, 54% cost reduction
- Telefónica: €6-8M annual savings

**Root Cause of Failure**:
- "Pilot purgatory" - companies dilute efforts across too many bets (average 6.1 use cases for laggards vs 3.5 for winners)
- No clear path to production, no defined financial KPIs, no C-suite sponsorship
- "Bolt-on" strategy - treating AI as add-on to existing broken processes
- Horizontal trap - deploying copilots that give diffuse, unmeasurable productivity gains

**Success Pattern**:
Winners redesign workflows from scratch around autonomous agent capabilities rather than bolting AI onto existing processes.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Resistance compounds implementation failure
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Winners focus on process redesign, not technology procurement
- [[Depth over breadth]] - 3.5 focused use cases beat 6.1 scattered pilots
- [[Context = Perspective + Information]] - Winners provide agents with full context via platform integration
- [[The Folder Paradigm]] - Successful agents need native access to systems, not bolt-on interfaces
