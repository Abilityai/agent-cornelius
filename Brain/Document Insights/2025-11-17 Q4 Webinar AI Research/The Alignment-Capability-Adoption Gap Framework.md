## Core Insight

The 95% failure rate can be explained by three systematic gaps that high performers close: Alignment Gap (strategy/leadership), Capability Gap (people/process), and Adoption Gap (measurement/scale). These gaps are the structural explanation for the GenAI Divide.

---

## Context & Evidence

**1. The Alignment Gap (Strategy & Leadership)**

Success factors:
- Senior leadership ownership: High performers 3x more likely to have active executive champions
- Strategic use case selection: Leaders prioritize operational/back-office (higher ROI but less visible) vs laggards' bias toward visible front-office
- Transformative ambition: High performers aim to transform business and create new value, not just cut costs

Failure pattern: 95% fail due to wrong use case selection and lack of committed senior leadership

**2. The Capability Gap (People & Process)**

Success factors:
- Workflow redesign: The 3x multiplier differentiator
- People-centric focus: 70% of effort on change management, training, collaboration (the 10-20-70 rule)
- Data readiness: Focus on cleaning up 80% of "old, inaccurate, confusing data" first

Failure pattern: Missing 40% of productivity gains due to talent strategy gap (EY), 60% of projects abandoned due to bad data (Gartner)

**3. The Adoption Gap (Measurement & Scale)**

Success factors:
- Rigorous measurement: #1 practice correlated with EBIT impact is tracking well-defined KPIs
- "Ground game" approach: Portfolio of small wins funding moonshots
- Continuous learning and iteration

Failure pattern: Only 15% have formal metrics (KPMG), 40% project cancellation rate from chasing only moonshots

**Framework Application:**
These three gaps provide:
- Diagnostic tool: Which gap is blocking your success?
- Implementation roadmap: Close gaps in sequence
- Strategic narrative: "Our platform closes these three gaps"
