## Core Insight

The single most important success factor in agentic AI is whether companies redesign workflows from scratch or bolt AI onto existing processes. Winners "re-architect workflows" and "change how work is actually done." Losers "bolt on" AI to existing, broken processes - automating chaos rather than creating new operating models.

## Context & Evidence

**McKinsey 2025 "State of AI" Report**:
Identifies "workflow redesign" as one of the strongest drivers of enterprise-level AI impact.

**The Fundamental Distinction**:
- **Winners**: Start with blank sheet, ask "What is the optimal autonomous way to do this?"
- **Losers**: Add AI agent to existing 20-step manual process, automate the chaos

**Why Bolt-On Fails**:
An agentic AI cannot fix a fundamentally flawed manual process. Simply "adding an agent" to a broken workflow just creates faster, automated dysfunction. The underlying process inefficiencies, handoffs, and delays remain - now executed by expensive AI.

**Success Example - ServiceNow**:
Their $350M in value came from agents that ARE the process, not add-ons to existing processes:
- IT agent doesn't "assist" with troubleshooting - it receives ticket, diagnoses, executes fix, closes ticket autonomously
- Finance agent doesn't "help with" procurement - it validates POs, routes approvals, processes payments as the core workflow
- Agents are "workflow-native," not "bolted on"

**The Integration Implication**:
Workflow redesign requires agents to be "natively embedded" in core systems with full context and permission to act. Bolt-on approaches treat agents as standalone tools without deep system integration.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The GenAI Divide - 95 Percent Failure Pattern]] - Bolt-on strategy is primary failure mode
- [[Intelligence-First vs Workflow-First Architecture]] - This maps to "redesign" (intelligence-first) vs "bolt-on" (workflow-first retrofit)
- [[Context = Perspective + Information]] - Redesigned workflows give agents full context; bolt-ons give partial context
- [[The Folder Paradigm]] - Agents need native memory and state management, impossible in bolt-on architecture
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Redesign requires builders who rethink processes, not coders who add features
