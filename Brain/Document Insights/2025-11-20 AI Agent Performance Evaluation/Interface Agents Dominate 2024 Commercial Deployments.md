## Core Insight

Interface agents - agents that accomplish tasks by driving interfaces (web browsers, desktop OS, etc.) - dominated commercial agent deployments in 2024. This reveals that production success comes from working within existing systems rather than requiring new infrastructure.

## Context & Evidence

**What Are Interface Agents:**
- Web automation agents (browser-based task completion)
- RPA (Robotic Process Automation) with LLMs
- Desktop automation agents
- Browser-based task completion
- UI navigation and interaction

**Why They Succeeded:**
Easier to integrate with existing systems without requiring:
- API access
- Infrastructure changes
- Backend modifications
- Custom integrations
- Security reviews for direct system access

**The Integration Advantage:**
Interface agents operate at the UI layer where humans already work, requiring no changes to underlying systems. This dramatically reduces deployment friction.

**Examples:**
- Web automation for data entry
- Browser-based research and information gathering
- Desktop workflow automation
- Cross-application task completion through UI interaction

**What This Reveals:**
Production deployments prioritize integration ease over architectural purity. The "proper" approach (API integration, structured data, custom tools) loses to the pragmatic approach (automate the UI like a human would).

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- **[[Workflow-first agent-second]]** - Interface agents are workflow automation with AI
- **Integration friction** - Minimizing friction determines adoption
- **Path of least resistance** - Production follows easiest integration, not optimal architecture
- **[[Psychological safety]]** - Familiar UI-based approach feels safer than API access
- **Pragmatism over purity** - Real-world deployment prioritizes what works over what's elegant
