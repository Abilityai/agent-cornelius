## Knowledge Base Contextualization

**Primary Topics Identified**: AI agent evaluation, production deployment, benchmarks, failure modes, safety

### Existing Knowledge Found

**Search Results**: Smart Connections returned no results for:
- AI agent evaluation metrics

**Gaps This Report Fills**:
- No existing coverage of agent evaluation methodologies

- No safety evaluation frameworks

### Extraction Priorities Set

**Focus Areas Identified**:
1. **Maturity gap paradox** (79% adoption, 1% maturity) - Empirical validation of adoption challenges
2. **Workflow-first paradigm** - Contrarian to autonomous agent narrative
3. **Failure taxonomies** (MAST framework) - Systematic understanding missing from vault
4. **Measurement epistemology** - What aggregate metrics hide
5. **Production evaluation** approaches - Bridges research to reality
6. **Safety frameworks** - Critical missing dimension

## Connection Opportunities

### Strong Matches to Existing Knowledge Base

**Psychological & Adoption Themes:**
- **[[Maturity Gap Paradox]]** validates **[[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]]** with empirical evidence
- **[[Workflow-First Paradigm]]** connects to **[[Psychological safety enables velocity]]** - workflows provide safety rails
- **[[Interface Agents Success]]** relates to path of least resistance and integration friction

**Measurement & Epistemology:**
- **[[Aggregate Metrics Mask Failures]]** relates to pattern completion and cognitive illusions
- **[[Benchmark Overfitting]]** connects to Goodhart's Law and confirmation bias
- Measurement epistemology - what gets measured determines what's visible/invisible

**Agent Architecture:**
- **[[Disconnected Models Problem]]** directly relates to **[[The Folder Paradigm]]** as solution
- **[[MAST Taxonomy]]** provides empirical grounding for agent failure modes
- Multi-agent coordination challenges validate existing insights on context fragmentation

**Safety & Alignment:**
- **[[Agentic Safety Risks]]** amplifies concerns in existing AI safety notes
- **[[Prompt Injection]]** as fundamental architectural vulnerability
- HITL regulatory requirements shape future agent design

### Gaps to Fill

**Missing Connections in Vault:**
- No systematic evaluation methodology notes (now filled)
- No production deployment best practices (now filled)
- No benchmark critique (now filled)
- No cost-efficiency analysis (now filled)
