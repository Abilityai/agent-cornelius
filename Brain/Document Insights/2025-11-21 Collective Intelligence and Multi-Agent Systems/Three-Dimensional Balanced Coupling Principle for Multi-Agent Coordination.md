## Core Insight

Success of collective decisions depends on balanced coupling across three dimensions: (1) intra-agent coupling (individual agent's internal coordination), (2) inter-agent coupling (social interactions between agents), and (3) agent-environment coupling (agent's responsiveness to external stimuli). This neuroscience principle from coordination dynamics framework applies directly to multi-agent AI system design.

## Context & Evidence

**Methodology**: Agents equipped with minimal neural dynamics based on coordination dynamics framework, embedded in environment with stimulus gradient. Multi-agent decisions emerged from sensorimotor coordination via simple social interactions.

**Key finding**: Simple neural dynamics can produce sophisticated collective decision-making without centralized control or complex architectures.

**First study**: Investigating collective decision-making in multi-agent systems modeling neural dynamics underlying sensorimotor coordination in embodied biological agents.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Flow is a selfless state]] - Optimal coupling creates "collective flow" where agents coordinate without self-referential boundaries
- [[Context = Perspective + Information]] - Agent-environment coupling determines information access, inter-agent coupling shares perspectives
- [[The Folder Paradigm]] - Intra-agent coupling = agent's internal folder organization, inter-agent coupling = folder sharing protocols
- [[Buddhism + Neuroscience + AI Triangle]] - Coordination dynamics validates interdependence principle across biological and artificial systems
