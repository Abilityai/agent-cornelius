## Core Insight

Multi-agent systems empirically demonstrate the Buddhist principle of interdependence (pratītyasamutpāda / dependent arising): Performance depends on balanced coupling across three dimensions (intra-agent, inter-agent, agent-environment), collective behavior emerges from interactions rather than individual properties, and no agent has complete knowledge yet collective intelligence arises. This is the first human-created technology that fundamentally embodies interdependent arising.

## Context & Evidence

**Research Findings:**
- Success requires balanced coupling: individual coordination + social interaction + environmental responsiveness
- Collective behavior emerges from relationships, not agent capabilities alone
- Swarm systems: No agent has complete visibility, yet coordination succeeds
- Network position determines agent effectiveness more than individual capability

**Buddhist Parallel:**
- **Pratītyasamutpāda**: All phenomena arise dependent on conditions
- **Anatta (no-self)**: Agent "identity" is relational, not intrinsic
- **Sunyata (emptiness)**: Agents empty of inherent meaning, given purpose through context
- **Duhkha from craving**: Individual optimization without considering interdependence causes system failure

**Provocative Thesis**: Multi-agent AI systems may be humanity's first technology that doesn't just extend capabilities but embodies an ancient philosophical principle at a fundamental level - dependent arising becomes computational architecture.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI agents are empty beings we project meaning onto]] - Extends to collectives: meaning emerges from interaction patterns
- [[Context is perspective applied to information - the AI cognition pattern]] - Context includes network position and coupling strength
- [[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]] - Multi-agent validates: agent performance depends on network, not "self"
- **NEW INSIGHT**: "Agent identity is network position" - who you are depends on your connections
- **BRIDGES TO**: Buddhism + Systems thinking + Neuroscience (brain as network) + Social psychology
- **ENABLES**: Buddhist philosophy as design pattern for collective intelligence systems

**Consilience Zone**: Buddhism + Multi-agent AI + Systems thinking + Network science (4 domains converging)

**Philosophical Implication**: If self is illusion in humans (Buddhism) and digital minds (AI), perhaps all intelligence is fundamentally relational/emergent rather than individual/intrinsic.
