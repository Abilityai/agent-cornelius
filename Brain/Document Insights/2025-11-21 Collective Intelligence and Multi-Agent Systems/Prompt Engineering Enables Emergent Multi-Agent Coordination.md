## Core Insight

Multi-agent LLM systems can transition from simple aggregates to sophisticated collectives exhibiting genuine coordination through prompt design alone, without requiring architectural changes. Using information-theoretic frameworks, researchers demonstrated that persona assignment plus collaborative instructions creates goal-directed complementarity mirroring human collective intelligence principles.

## Context & Evidence

**Experimental conditions tested:**
- Control: Showed temporal synergy with minimal cross-agent alignment
- Persona assignment: Introduced stable identity-linked differentiation between agents
- Personas + collaborative instruction: Demonstrated goal-directed complementarity

**Key framework**: Partial information decomposition of time-delayed mutual information rigorously characterizes emergence vs. simple aggregation.

**Critical finding**: Effective collective performance requires BOTH shared objective alignment AND complementary contributions. Alignment alone is insufficient.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The Folder Paradigm]] - Persona assignment creates persistent agent identity similar to folder-based memory
- [[Context = Perspective + Information]] - Prompt engineering shapes perspective without changing information processing architecture
- [[Identity is a Set of Beliefs]] - Agent identity emerges from role assignment (persona prompts)
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Demonstrates software changes (prompts) unlock capabilities without hardware/model changes
