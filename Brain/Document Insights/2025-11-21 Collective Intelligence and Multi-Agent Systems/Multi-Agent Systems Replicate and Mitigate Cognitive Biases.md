## Core Insight

Multi-agent systems both replicate human cognitive biases (groupthink when homogeneous) and provide structured mechanisms to mitigate them (heterogeneous debate, devil's advocate agents). Similar agent capabilities result in static debate dynamics converging to majority opinion, paralleling human confirmation bias, but intentionally designed diversity and structured debate protocols reduce collective noise analogous to Mediating Assessments Protocol (MAP) for human judgment.

## Context & Evidence

**How Multi-Agent Systems REPLICATE Biases:**

1. **Groupthink**: Homogeneous agents converge without critical evaluation
2. **Confirmation Bias**: Agents reinforce each other's initial beliefs
3. **Overconfidence**: Lack of diverse perspectives prevents calibration
4. **Behavioral Inconsistency**: At scale, agents demonstrate systematic deviations

**How Multi-Agent Systems MITIGATE Biases:**

1. **Heterogeneous Teams**: Diverse agents challenge assumptions (+47% performance)
2. **Structured Debate**: Multi-agent debate (MAD) outperforms single-agent chain-of-thought
3. **Devil's Advocate Agents**: Designated contrary positions prevent premature consensus
4. **Ensemble Predictions**: Averaging reduces individual biases
5. **Cross-Verification**: Multiple perspectives improve complex reasoning

**Critical Success Factors for Debate:**
- Adaptive break: Knowing when to stop debating
- Modest "tit for tat": Some back-and-forth improves outcomes, excessive cycles degrade
- Diversity requirement: Similar capabilities → groupthink

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Force ranking beats evaluative judgment for reducing noise]] - Structured debate = multi-agent force ranking
- [[LLMs exhibit significantly lower decision noise than humans]] - But homogeneous LLMs create echo chambers
- [[Confirmation bias shapes AI agent evaluation just like human relationships]] - Extends to agent-agent dynamics
- [[Finding a confirmation of the belief creates a spike of Dopamine]] - Multi-agent confirmation intensifies belief reinforcement
- **NEW DESIGN PATTERN**: "Cognitive Bias Audit" - test systems for bias susceptibility, engineer countermeasures
- **BRIDGES TO**: Decision science + Cognitive psychology + Organizational behavior
- **ENABLES**: Multi-agent systems as testbed for human bias mitigation strategies

**Consilience Zone**: Multi-agent AI + Decision science + Cognitive psychology + Neuroscience (dopamine) (4 domains)

**Research Opportunity**: Use multi-agent systems to empirically test interventions for reducing human cognitive biases at scale before deploying in organizations.
