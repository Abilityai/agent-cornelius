## Core Insight

Heterogeneous multi-agent systems (different LLM models assigned to specialized roles) yield up to 47% performance improvement on complex tasks compared to homogeneous systems. The design principle is to match agent heterogeneity to task decomposability - tasks that can be parallelized benefit most from specialization.

## Context & Evidence

**The Spark Workflow**: Samples diverse subset of persona-conditioned agents per task, generating answers with heterogeneous reasoning styles to improve creativity and problem-solving.

**Specialization drivers:**
- Task parallelizability: Decomposable tasks encourage specialization
- Environment structure: Layout and interaction patterns promote/inhibit policy diversity
- Hierarchical organization: Agents in hierarchies exhibit more specialized roles

**Key finding**: Diverse agents provide complementary strengths, reducing collective blind spots. Homogeneous teams converge to majority opinion without critical evaluation (groupthink).

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Confirmation bias shapes AI agent evaluation]] - Homogeneous agents reinforce each other's biases
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Resistance to heterogeneity mirrors human resistance to cognitive diversity
- [[Mediating Assessments Protocol (MAP)]] - Structured heterogeneity reduces noise similar to MAP reducing human judgment noise
- [[Outside view vs inside view]] - Different agents provide outside perspectives on same problem
