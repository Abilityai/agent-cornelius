## Core Insight

GPT-4o-mini (smaller, more efficient model) achieved highest average task score across MultiAgentBench scenarios, outperforming larger models in multi-agent contexts. Smaller models excel when properly specialized and coordinated within heterogeneous teams, challenging the assumption that capability scales linearly with model size - collective intelligence architecture matters more than individual agent power.

## Context & Evidence

**Performance Results:**
- GPT-4o-mini: Highest average across diverse interactive scenarios
- Outperformed larger, more expensive models
- Especially effective in graph-based coordination structures
- Cost efficiency: Fraction of compute compared to GPT-4

**Why Smaller Models Succeed in Multi-Agent:**

1. **Specialization Advantage**
   - Smaller models can be fine-tuned for specific roles
   - Less prone to over-generalization
   - Faster inference enables more interaction cycles

2. **Coordination Amplification**
   - Effective topology compensates for individual limitations
   - Collective capability exceeds any individual agent
   - Diversity bonus: Different-sized models provide complementary strengths

3. **Resource Efficiency**
   - More agents per budget
   - Enables larger team sizes
   - Faster experimentation and iteration

4. **Reduced Brittleness**
   - Smaller models less likely to exhibit overconfident hallucinations
   - More predictable behavior in constrained roles
   - Easier to debug and interpret

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Horizontal AI Agents dominate over Vertical solutions in early markets]] - Smaller, general models win through adaptability
- [[Context engineering replaces prompt engineering - agent success is system design]] - Architecture > individual capability
- [[Parallel agents force abstraction shift - cognitive bandwidth becomes the bottleneck]] - Smaller models reduce cognitive overhead
- [[Agent fitness through sustained utility to users and other agents]] - Fitness isn't about capability alone but fit to system
- **NEW PRINCIPLE**: "Collective architecture beats individual capability" - system design dominates agent power
- **BRIDGES TO**: Economics (comparative advantage), Biology (specialization in ecosystems), Engineering (modularity)

**Consilience Zone**: Multi-agent AI + Economics (division of labor) + Evolution (specialization) + Systems design

**Practical Implication**: Don't default to largest available model. Design heterogeneous teams with right-sized models for each role, optimizing for system-level performance and cost.

**Counter-Intuitive Insight**: Adding more capable agents can degrade performance if it disrupts coordination patterns - "good enough" agents with excellent coordination beat "excellent" agents with poor coordination.
