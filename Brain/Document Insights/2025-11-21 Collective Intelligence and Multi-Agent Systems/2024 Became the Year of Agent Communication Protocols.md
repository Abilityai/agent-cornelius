## Core Insight

"2024 became the year of the protocol" - significant industry investment in agent infrastructure resulted in four emerging standardized communication protocols addressing interoperability: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP). This represents ecosystem maturation from custom implementations to shared standards.

## Context & Evidence

**Four Protocol Types:**
1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Context sharing across different models
2. **Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)**: Standardized agent messaging formats
3. **Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)**: Direct peer-to-peer communication
4. **Agent Network Protocol (ANP)**: Network-level coordination and routing

**Significance**: Moving from "every team builds their own" to "shared infrastructure enables composition." Similar to how HTTP enabled the web by standardizing communication.

**Implication**: Multi-agent systems transitioning from research prototypes to production infrastructure. Standards enable interoperability, agent marketplaces, and cross-organization coordination.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The Folder Paradigm]] - Protocols define how agents' "folders" (memory/state) are shared and synchronized
- [[Context = Perspective + Information]] - MCP specifically addresses context sharing (perspective + information) across models
- [[Agent-to-agent coupling is more brittle than human-to-software coupling]] - Standardized protocols reduce brittleness through well-defined interfaces
- [[Recreation beats comprehension]] - Protocols enable agents to recreate each other's context without deep comprehension
