## Core Insight

Key principle for AI-enhanced collective intelligence: "AI should support and enhance human collaborative processes rather than replace human intelligence." Research on human-AI hybrid collectives demonstrates optimal performance combines human creativity with AI computational power through five roles: assistant, teammate, coach, manager, and embodied partner. The multilayer framework (cognition, physical, information) shows how AI can enhance without supplanting.

## Context & Evidence

**Five AI Roles in Collective Intelligence:**
1. **Assistant**: Technical tool augmenting abilities (data analysis, search)
2. **Teammate**: Collaborating with humans (co-writing, co-design)
3. **Coach**: Providing guidance and feedback (skill development)
4. **Manager**: Optimizing task allocation (resource distribution)
5. **Embodied partner**: Physical interaction (robotics, automation)

**Multilayer Framework:**
- Cognition layer: Mental processes, reasoning, decision-making
- Physical layer: Tangible interactions, embodied actions
- Information layer: Communication, data exchange, knowledge sharing

**Applications**: Public sector, healthcare, education, financial services, agriculture, media, telecommunications.

**Critical distinction**: Augmentation preserves human agency and creativity while adding computational capability. Replacement eliminates human judgment and adaptability.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Framing AI as augmentation reduces adoption resistance vs. replacement threat
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - Augmentation model requires humans who direct AI capabilities (builders)
- [[Professional identity creates AI resistance]] - Augmentation preserves professional identity while adding tools
- [[Psychological safety enables velocity not comfort]] - Human-AI teams require psychological safety for effective collaboration
