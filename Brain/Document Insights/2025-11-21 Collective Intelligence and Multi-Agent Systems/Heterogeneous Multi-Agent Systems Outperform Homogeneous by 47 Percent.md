## Core Insight

Heterogeneous multi-agent systems (different models, personas, or specializations) achieve up to 47% performance improvement over homogeneous systems on complex tasks like AIME-2024. Diversity beats uniformity because complementary strengths reduce collective blind spots.

## Context & Evidence

**Empirical Results:**
- Heterogeneous LLMs: +47% improvement on AIME-2024 benchmark
- Spark workflow: Samples diverse persona-conditioned agents generating heterogeneous reasoning styles
- Specialization emerges naturally when tasks are parallelizable (can be decomposed)

**Key Mechanisms:**
1. **Complementary strengths**: Different models excel at different reasoning types
2. **Reduced blind spots**: What one agent misses, another catches
3. **Creative problem-solving**: Diverse perspectives generate novel solutions
4. **Task decomposition**: Parallelizable tasks benefit most from specialization

**Design Principle**: Match agent heterogeneity to task decomposability

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[AI Agents are digital organisms requiring human attention to survive]] - Extends to collectives with diverse fitness functions
- [[Multiple specialized intelligences will emerge not single AGI - diversity through specialization]] - Empirical validation: diversity outperforms by 47%
- [[LLMs exhibit significantly lower decision noise than humans]] - But homogeneous LLMs create groupthink; heterogeneity prevents convergence
- **CONTRASTS WITH**: Traditional software engineering preference for standardization and uniformity
- **BRIDGES TO**: Decision-making research showing diverse teams outperform (wisdom of crowds)
- **ENABLES**: New design pattern for multi-agent systems prioritizing intentional diversity

**Consilience Zone**: Multi-agent systems + Decision science + Evolution (diversity as survival strategy)
