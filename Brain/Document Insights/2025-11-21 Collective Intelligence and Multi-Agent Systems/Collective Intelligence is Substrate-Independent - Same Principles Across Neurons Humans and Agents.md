## Core Insight

Collective intelligence exhibits substrate-independence: the same principles governing neuron collectives (brains), human collectives (organizations), biological collectives (ant colonies), and artificial agent collectives. Universal patterns include emergence through interaction, self-organization without central control, balance of autonomy and coupling, complementarity over redundancy, and communication as infrastructure.

## Context & Evidence

**Universal Patterns Across Substrates:**
1. **Emergence through interaction**: Intelligence arises from relationships, not individual capabilities
2. **Self-organization without central control**: Decentralized coordination produces system-level behavior
3. **Balance of autonomy and coupling**: Optimal performance requires tuning individual vs. collective emphasis
4. **Complementarity over redundancy**: Diverse, specialized roles outperform homogeneity
5. **Communication as infrastructure**: Information flow determines collective capability

**Convergence Evidence:**
- Neuroscience coordination dynamics apply to multi-agent AI (Finding 5)
- Human collective intelligence principles manifest in LLM agent groups (Finding 1)
- Buddhist interdependence validated in digital systems (Cross-domain connection 2)
- Swarm robotics mirrors biological swarm behavior (Finding 6)

**Profound Implication**: We may have discovered universal laws of collective intelligence analogous to thermodynamics - principles that hold regardless of substrate.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Buddhism + Neuroscience + AI Triangle]] - Extends to include collective intelligence as fourth domain
- [[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]] - True across all substrates: neurons, humans, agents all lack inherent self
- [[Interdependent arising]] - Pratītyasamutpāda manifests identically in biological and digital collectives
- [[Flow is a selfless state]] - Collective flow achievable in neuron networks, human teams, and agent swarms
