## Core Insight

Swarm robotics research demonstrates that optimal performance occurs with 16 or fewer agents for low-dimensional optimization problems. The Swarm Cooperation Model (SCM) achieved success rates higher than or equal to benchmarks on 22 out of 33 landscapes tested. Counter-intuitively, more agents don't always improve performance - there's an optimal scale determined by problem structure.

## Context & Evidence

**Swarm Cooperation Model (SCM)**: Governs balance between social interactions, cognitive stimuli, and stochastic fluctuations. Balance between individual (cognitive) and group (social) information drives collective accomplishment.

**Performance factors**:
- Problem dimensionality determines optimal swarm size
- Too many agents create coordination overhead
- Too few agents lack diversity for exploration
- Sweet spot depends on task structure

**Applications**: Virtual optimizer, vehicle controller, multimodal function optimization, contaminant source localization.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Context window bloat degrades performance despite more information]] - More agents = more information but degraded coordination beyond optimal scale
- [[Agents lose big picture like humans lose forest for trees]] - Large swarms lose coherence similar to context window overload
- [[The Folder Paradigm]] - Each agent = folder, but too many folders create management overhead
