## Core Insight

Agents modeling other agents' beliefs (Theory of Mind) enables sophisticated collaboration in competitive, cooperative, and mixed-motive scenarios with concealed information. Language model-based Inverse Multi-agent Planning (LIMP) significantly outperformed GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5 Pro, and recent multi-modal ToM models. Hypothetical Minds significantly outperformed LLM-based and RL baselines in every environment.

## Context & Evidence

**MuMA-ToM Benchmark**: First multi-modal ToM benchmark evaluating mental reasoning in embodied multi-agent interactions, providing video and text descriptions of multi-modal behavior in realistic household environments.

**Critical capability**: In partially observable environments with concealed information, accurate belief modeling enables strategic planning. Understanding others' mental states is essential for realistic social interaction simulation.

**Key distinction**: Theory of Mind reasoning goes beyond observable behavior to model internal beliefs, intentions, and knowledge states of other agents.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - ToM models how other agents resolve uncertainty through beliefs
- [[Identity is a Set of Beliefs]] - ToM recognizes that other agents have belief-based identities distinct from self
- [[Context = Perspective + Information]] - ToM means modeling another agent's perspective and information state
- [[Ego & Self is what it feels like to be thinking without knowing you are thinking]] - ToM requires distinguishing self's thinking from models of others' thinking
