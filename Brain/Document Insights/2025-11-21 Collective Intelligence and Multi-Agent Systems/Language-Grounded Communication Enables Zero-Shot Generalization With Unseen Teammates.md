## Core Insight

Aligning agent communication protocols with human natural language embeddings enables zero-shot generalization in ad-hoc teamwork with previously unseen teammates. Agents can coordinate with new partners immediately without retraining because they share the semantic structure of natural language as a common ground.

---

## Context & Evidence

**Mechanism**: Instead of learning arbitrary communication protocols, agents ground their messages in natural language embedding space. This creates inherent interpretability and transferability.

**Performance**: Agents trained with language-grounded communication successfully coordinate with teammates they've never encountered during training.

**Key advantage**: Natural language provides universal semantic grounding. Like humans meeting strangers but sharing a language, agents can cooperate immediately through shared linguistic structure.

**Implication**: Multi-agent systems become compositional - mix and match agents from different teams/organizations if they share language grounding.
