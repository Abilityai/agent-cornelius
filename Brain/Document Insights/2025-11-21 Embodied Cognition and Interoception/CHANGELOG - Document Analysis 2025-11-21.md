## Deduplication Results

### Duplicates Found (Not Created)
**NONE** - All searches returned empty results, confirming this is virgin territory in the knowledge base.

### Very Similar (Judgment Calls)
**NONE** - No similar notes exist. Embodiment/interoception was completely underrepresented.

**Search Strategy Used**:
- Searched for: "interoception embodied cognition body awareness"
- Searched for: "consciousness self illusion Buddhist neuroscience"
- Searched for: "predictive processing prediction error brain"
- Searched for: "flow states selfless performance peak"
- Searched for: "AI agents embodiment artificial intelligence"

**After**: Somatic mechanisms underlying cognitive phenomena

**Before**: Buddhism as philosophy
**After**: Buddhism as validated neuroscience protocol

**Before**: AI agents as disembodied computation
**After**: AI requires embodiment for genuine intelligence

### Intellectual Trajectory

**2023-2024**: Synthesis phase (connecting ideas, building frameworks)
**2024-2025**: AI integration phase (121 AI insights)
**2025 (This Session)**: Embodiment phase (grounding mind in body)

**Next Phase Predicted**: Integration synthesis (embodied AI + consciousness + Buddhism unified framework)

### Consilience Achievement

**Independent Convergence**:
- Buddhism (2,500 years): Self as illusion, body awareness primary
- Neuroscience (2025): Interoceptive inference creates self, 7T validation
- AI Research (2024-2025): Embodiment required for intelligence

All three independently arrive at: **Mind requires body, cognition is embodied, self is constructed through bodily prediction.**

This is consilience - confirmation through independent inquiry.
