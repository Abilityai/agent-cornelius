## Core Insight

Mental health disorders show dysregulated **precision weighting** of interoceptive signals rather than simply inaccurate perception. **Anxiety overweights interoceptive precision** (excessive attention to bodily signals), **PTSD underweights precision** (disconnection from bodily signals), and **depression shows inflexible precision** (inability to adapt weighting during physiological changes). This framework shifts therapeutic targets from accuracy to precision modulation.

## Context & Evidence

**The Precision Weighting Framework**:
In predictive processing, the brain doesn't just predict body states - it assigns **precision weights** determining how much to trust interoceptive signals vs. predictions. Higher precision = more influence on perception and behavior.

**Empirical Findings (2024-2025)**:

**Anxiety Disorders**:
- Overweighted interoception = excessive focus on bodily signals
- Normal heart rate perceived as threatening
- Catastrophic interpretation of benign sensations
- Cannot down-regulate attention to body

**PTSD/Dissociation**:
- Underweighted interoception = disconnection from bodily signals
- Protective numbing of body awareness
- Reduced ability to detect genuine physiological needs
- Disconnection from somatic warning signals

**Depression**:
- Inflexible precision weighting
- Cannot adapt precision during breath-holding or other perturbations
- Healthy individuals increase cardiac precision during interoceptive challenge; depressed patients do not
- Prevents accurate perception of changing body states

**Substance Use & Eating Disorders**:
- Transdiagnostic failure to adapt interoceptive precision estimates
- Unable to adjust beliefs about signal reliability
- Leads to misperception of hunger, satiety, cravings, withdrawal

**Key 2024 Study**: During breath-holding (interoceptive perturbation), healthy individuals increased precision-weighting of cardiac signals; patients with anxiety, depression, substance use, and eating disorders **did not adapt precision**.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - Precision weighting is how the brain manages uncertainty about body states
- **Dopamine Connection**: Dopamine may modulate precision weighting (high dopamine = increased precision on reward-relevant signals)
- **Buddhism/Equanimity**: Meditation trains precision down-regulation - non-reactive awareness of body sensations without over-weighting them
- **Decision-Making**: Dysregulated interoceptive precision affects "gut feelings" and somatic markers
- **Clinical Treatment**: Suggests interventions should target precision modulation, not just accuracy improvement

## Therapeutic Implications

**Precision-Targeted Interventions**:

**For Anxiety (Overweighted)**:
- Train precision down-regulation
- Teach external attentional focus
- Reduce catastrophic interpretation of signals
- Biofeedback showing benign nature of sensations

**For PTSD (Underweighted)**:
- Gradual interoceptive exposure
- Precision up-regulation in safe contexts
- Bottom-up somatic therapies
- Rebuild trust in body signals

**For Depression (Inflexible)**:
- Train adaptive precision modulation
- Biofeedback during physiological challenges
- Practice adjusting attention based on context
- HRV biofeedback with precision tracking

**Paradigm Shift**: From "improve interoceptive accuracy" to "optimize precision weighting flexibility" - the ability to adjust how much you trust body signals based on context.

## Research Mechanism

**Why Precision Matters More Than Accuracy**:
- You can accurately detect heartbeats but still have anxiety (over-weighting threat interpretation)
- You can have poor accuracy but good mental health (appropriate precision for context)
- Flexibility to adjust precision is key to adaptive functioning

**Predictive Processing Account**:
1. Brain generates predictions about body states
2. Assigns precision weights to prediction errors
3. High precision errors → update beliefs strongly
4. Low precision errors → ignore as noise
5. **Pathology = rigid precision that doesn't adapt to context**
