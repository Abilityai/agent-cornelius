## Core Insight

Growth is not about doing everything - it's about doing the right thing at the right time. The framework's power lies in its diagnostic capability: helping teams recognize whether they need a new engine, more fuel, better lubricants, or strategic turbo boosts. Understanding the distinction prevents the most common growth failure mode: solving the wrong problem with expensive solutions.

## Context & Evidence

**From the article - Meta-Insight:**
"Growth is not about doing everything - it's about doing the right thing at the right time."

"The framework's power lies in its diagnostic capability: helping teams recognize whether they need:
- A new engine (fundamental growth mechanism change)
- More fuel (resources to power existing engine)
- Better lubricants (optimization of current systems)
- Strategic turbo boosts (temporary acceleration for specific goals)

Understanding the distinction prevents the most common growth failure mode: solving the wrong problem with expensive solutions."

**The diagnostic framework prevents:**
1. Building new channels when existing ones need optimization
2. Optimizing incrementally when fundamental change is required
3. Treating temporary tactics as sustainable strategies
4. Applying wrong resources to growth mechanisms

**Key strategic question:**
"Knowing when to focus on what is the key and where most mistakes are made."

**Context-dependent strategy:**
- **Early stage S-curve:** Focus on finding the right engine
- **Growth stage:** Add fuel and lubricants to existing engine
- **Maturity:** May need new engine or significant pivots

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Intelligence Points - Discrete Decision Nodes in Process Flows]] - Similar principle: minimum intelligence points needed for adaptability (not maximum)
- [[The Intelligence Point Audit Framework - Process Design Method]] - Parallel diagnostic: right solution for each process step
- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - Teams want simple rules ("always optimize" or "always innovate") but context determines right action
- [[Mental Models Taxonomy]] - This is a diagnostic LENS for growth decisions

**Builds On:**
The principle that effective strategy requires matching solution to context, not applying universal rules.

**Enables:**
- Resource allocation based on diagnosis, not assumptions
- Stage-appropriate growth tactics
- Avoiding expensive wrong solutions
