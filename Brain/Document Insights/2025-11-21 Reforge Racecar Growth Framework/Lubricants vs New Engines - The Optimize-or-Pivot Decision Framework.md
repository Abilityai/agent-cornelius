## Core Insight

Most growth failures stem from solving the wrong problem: teams optimize when they should pivot (pursuing lubricants when a new engine is needed) OR pivot when they should optimize (pursuing new engines when lubricants are necessary). Knowing when to focus on what is the key strategic decision.

## Context & Evidence

**From the article - Common Mistakes #3 and #4:**

**Mistake #3: Overemphasizing Lubricants when a new Growth Engine is required**
- Optimizing existing systems when fundamental change is needed
- Incremental improvements instead of strategic pivots
- Trying to squeeze more efficiency from a depleted engine

**Mistake #4: Pursuing a new growth engine when Lubricants are necessary**
- Looking for new tactics when current engine just needs optimization
- **Most common mistake:** Chasing new channels when existing ones aren't fully optimized

**The strategic question:** "Knowing when to focus on what is the key and where most mistakes are made."

**Framework for decision:**
1. Assess current engine's potential (is it fundamentally working?)
2. Identify if friction is reducing efficiency (lubricant opportunity)
3. Determine if engine has reached natural ceiling (new engine needed)
4. Recognize S-curve stage to guide decision

**Lubricant examples:**
- Improved conversion rates
- Better onboarding flows
- Stronger brand positioning
- Higher retention

These enhance existing growth mechanisms but don't create new ones.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Intelligence Points - Discrete Decision Nodes in Process Flows]] - Similar framework: knowing when to add intelligence vs optimize workflow
- [[The Intelligence Point Audit Framework - Process Design Method]] - Parallel decision: optimize existing or add new intelligence point
- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - Teams cling to "optimize existing" or "find new engine" beliefs to reduce strategic uncertainty
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Similar pattern: companies optimize old processes when they need new AI-native workflows

**Contrasts With:**
- Intelligence Point framework asks "intelligence or workflow?"
- Racecar framework asks "optimize or pivot?"
- Both require distinguishing incremental improvement from fundamental change
