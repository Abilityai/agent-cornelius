## Core Insight

Different growth engines require fundamentally different types of fuel (inputs). Misunderstanding the specific fuel requirements of your business leads to ineffective growth strategies - like putting diesel in a gasoline engine.

## Context & Evidence

**From the article - Common Mistake #5:**
"Misunderstanding the specific fuel requirements of the business: Applying wrong resources to growth engine. Not recognizing what actually powers your growth."

**Fuel types by engine:**
- **Performance marketing engine** → Requires capital (money for ads, bidding)
- **Content marketing engine** → Requires content production capacity (writers, creators)
- **Viral growth engine** → Requires initial users (to trigger network effects)
- **Sales-driven growth** → Requires sales capacity (people, training, infrastructure)

**The mistake:**
A company with a content marketing engine tries to pour money (capital) into it expecting linear growth, but the engine needs **creator capacity**, not just budget. Or a viral product tries to hire salespeople when it needs more initial users to achieve critical mass.

**Why this matters:**
Even a perfect growth engine won't work if you're providing the wrong type of input. The framework makes explicit what each engine type actually consumes and produces.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Intelligence Points - Discrete Decision Nodes in Process Flows]] - Similar concept: different intelligence points require different fuel (data, compute, human judgment)
- [[AI agents transitioning from organism to fitness function]] - Fitness functions optimize for specific resources (attention, usage, satisfaction)
- [[Context = Perspective + Information]] - Agents need right TYPE of information (fuel) not just more information
- [[Design AI agents to function without memory then enhance]] - Wrong fuel = adding memory when agent needs better prompt engineering

**Parallel to AI systems:**
- AI agent with **reasoning engine** needs compute/time (Claude with extended thinking)
- AI agent with **retrieval engine** needs indexed knowledge base
- AI agent with **tool-use engine** needs API access and permissions
- Providing wrong resource type (more tokens when it needs tools) = wrong fuel
