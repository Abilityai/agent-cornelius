## Core Insight

The Growth Engine is fundamentally different from other growth tactics because it's the only component with the potential to be self-sustaining. Engines naturally create an output that can then be re-invested in more growth, creating a compounding loop.

## Context & Evidence

**From the article:**
"The Growth Engine is the most important component because it's the only one with the potential to be self-sustaining. Engines naturally create an output that can then be re-invested in more growth."

**Examples of growth engines:**
- Virality (users generate more users)
- Performance marketing (revenue funds more ads)
- Content marketing (content attracts audience that justifies more content)
- Sales (revenue funds more sales capacity)

**The key characteristic:** Growth engines have a feedback loop where output becomes input for the next cycle.

**Contrast with other components:**
- Turbo Boosts: One-off events (PR, Super Bowl ads) that spike then fade
- Lubricants: Make engines more efficient but don't generate growth themselves
- Fuel: Required inputs but don't create the loop mechanism

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Dopamine and Uncertainty]] - Self-reinforcing loops similar to dopamine reward cycles
- [[Attention as universal selection pressure across biological and digital systems]] - Attention creates self-reinforcing loops for content/agents
- [[Intelligence Points - Discrete Decision Nodes in Process Flows]] - Growth engines may need intelligence points at key decision nodes
- [[AI agents transitioning from organism to fitness function]] - Fitness functions are self-sustaining loops (similar to growth engines)
