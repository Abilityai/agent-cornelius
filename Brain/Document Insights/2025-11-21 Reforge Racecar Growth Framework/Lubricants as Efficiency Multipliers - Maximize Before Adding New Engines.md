## Core Insight

Lubricants are optimizations that make the growth engine run more efficiently. The strategic role is to maximize the output of your existing growth engine before investing in new engines - squeezing more performance from proven mechanisms before adding complexity.

## Context & Evidence

**From the article:**
"Lubricants: Optimizations that make the growth engine run more efficiently. Strategic Role: Maximize the output of your existing growth engine before investing in new engines."

**Lubricant examples:**
- Improved customer conversion rates
- Stronger brand positioning
- Higher customer retention
- Better product experience
- Optimized onboarding flows

**Key characteristic:**
Lubricants enhance existing growth mechanisms by improving efficiency and reducing friction. They don't create new growth channels but make current ones perform better.

**Strategic principle:**
Before pursuing a new growth engine (expensive, risky, complex), first ensure your current engine is running at maximum efficiency through lubricants.

**The optimization question:**
"Is our conversion rate at 2% because our engine is wrong, or because there's friction we haven't removed?"

If engine is fundamentally sound but underperforming, lubricants can 2-3x output without changing core mechanism.

**When to prioritize lubricants:**
- Current engine is validated (works but underperforms)
- Clear friction points identified (low conversion, high churn)
- S-curve growth stage (scaling proven engine)
- Before investing in new channels

**When lubricants aren't enough:**
- Engine has hit natural ceiling
- Market fundamentally shifted
- S-curve maturity stage
- Friction removal yields diminishing returns

- [[Intelligence Points - Discrete Decision Nodes in Process Flows]] - Lubricants = workflow optimization between intelligence points
- [[The Intelligence Point Audit Framework - Process Design Method]] - Optimize workflows before adding new intelligence points
- [[Context Window Bloat reduces AI agent performance]] - Too much context = friction that needs lubricant (pruning, summarization)
- [[Design AI agents to function without memory then enhance]] - Optimize core functionality (lubricant) before adding memory (new engine)

**Parallel to AI systems:**
- **Lubricants for AI agents:**
  - Better prompt engineering (reduce token waste)
  - Context pruning (remove friction)
  - Faster response caching (reduce latency)
  - Tool optimization (reduce API calls)

- **New engine for AI agents:**
  - Adding memory systems
  - Adding new tool integrations
  - Switching to different LLM
  - Architectural redesign

**Strategic parallel:**
Before adding memory to an agent (new engine), first optimize its prompts and context management (lubricants).
