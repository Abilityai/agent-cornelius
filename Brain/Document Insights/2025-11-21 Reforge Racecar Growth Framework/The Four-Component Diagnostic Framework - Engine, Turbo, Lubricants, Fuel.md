## Core Insight

The Racecar Framework provides a systematic four-component diagnostic model for analyzing growth strategies. By categorizing all growth activities into Engine (self-sustaining loops), Turbo Boosts (temporary acceleration), Lubricants (efficiency optimizations), and Fuel (required inputs), teams can identify what they actually need rather than pursuing whatever seems to be working for others.

## Context & Evidence

**The Four Components:**

1. **⚙️ Engine - Self-sustaining growth loops**
   - Examples: Virality, performance marketing, content marketing, sales
   - Characteristic: Output reinvests in more growth (compounding)
   - Most important because only component with self-sustaining potential

2. **💥 Turbo Boosts - One-off temporary accelerators**
   - Examples: PR campaigns, events, Super Bowl ads, launches
   - Characteristic: Short-term spike, not repeatable
   - Role: Momentum building, awareness, not sustainable strategy

3. **💧 Lubricants - Efficiency optimizations**
   - Examples: Conversion optimization, brand positioning, retention, onboarding
   - Characteristic: Make existing engine run more efficiently
   - Role: Maximize output before investing in new engines

4. **⛽️ Fuel - Required inputs**
   - Examples: Capital, content, users, sales capacity
   - Characteristic: Resources that power growth strategies
   - Role: Different engines require different fuel types

**Diagnostic Questions Framework:**
- What is our current growth engine?
- Is it running efficiently (lubricants)?
- Do we have the right fuel for it?
- Are we confusing turbo boosts with sustainable engines?
- At what stage of the S-curve are we?

**Strategic Application:**
The framework prevents three critical failures:
1. Resource misallocation (wrong fuel type)
2. Strategic confusion (turbo boosts mistaken for engines)
3. Timing errors (optimizing when pivoting needed, or vice versa)

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Mental Models Taxonomy]] - This is a LENS for growth strategy analysis (similar to lenses/biases/tools taxonomy)
- [[The Intelligence Point Audit Framework - Process Design Method]] - Parallel four-step diagnostic framework for process design
- [[Intelligence Points - Discrete Decision Nodes in Process Flows]] - Similar systematic categorization approach
- [[Mediating Assessments Protocol (MAP)]] - Structured decision protocols reduce noise in judgment

**Framework Structure Parallel:**

**Racecar Framework:**
- 4 categories (Engine, Turbo, Lubricants, Fuel)
- Diagnostic questions for each
- Decision rules based on context (S-curve stage)

**Intelligence Point Framework:**
- 4 dimensions (Uncertainty, Judgment, Cost of Error, Volume)
- Scoring method for each
- Decision rules based on scores

**Both frameworks:**
- Make implicit decisions explicit
- Provide systematic diagnostic method
- Replace intuition with structured analysis
- Enable context-appropriate choices
