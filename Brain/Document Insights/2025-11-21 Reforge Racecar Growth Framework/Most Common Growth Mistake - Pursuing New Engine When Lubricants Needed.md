## Core Insight

The most common growth mistake is pursuing a new growth engine when lubricants are necessary - looking for new tactics when the current engine just needs optimization. Specifically, chasing new channels when existing ones aren't fully optimized.

## Context & Evidence

**From the article - Common Mistake #4:**
"Pursuing a new growth engine when Lubricants are necessary: Looking for new tactics when current engine just needs optimization. **Most common mistake:** chasing new channels when existing ones aren't fully optimized."

**Why this happens:**

1. **Novelty bias**
   - New channels seem exciting and promising
   - Optimization feels boring and incremental
   - "Grass is greener" thinking

2. **Optimization fatigue**
   - Teams hit local maximum in current channel
   - Assume they've exhausted potential
   - Don't recognize there's more efficiency to unlock

3. **External pressure**
   - Competitors are on new channels
   - Executives want growth acceleration
   - Investors ask about diversification

4. **Difficulty diagnosing**
   - Hard to tell if engine is at ceiling or just needs lubricants
   - Easier to blame the channel than execution
   - Conversion optimization requires deep expertise

**The cost:**
- Diverts resources from proven channel to unproven one
- Loses focus and compounds mediocrity across channels
- Misses 2-3x gains available from optimization
- Adds operational complexity without strategic value

**The diagnostic test:**
Before pursuing new channel, ask:
- Is our conversion rate industry-leading? (If no → lubricants needed)
- Have we A/B tested major friction points? (If no → lubricants needed)
- Is our retention/LTV optimized? (If no → lubricants needed)
- Have we maximized this channel's TAM? (If no → lubricants needed)

Only pursue new engine when current one is truly optimized AND hitting natural ceiling.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[The Intelligence Point Audit Framework - Process Design Method]] - Similar mistake: adding new intelligence points when workflows need optimization
- [[Intelligence Points - Discrete Decision Nodes in Process Flows]] - Minimize intelligence points while maximizing adaptability (similar principle)
- [[Pattern completion creates illusion of understanding]] - Mind completes pattern "growth slowed = need new channel" without testing alternatives
- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - Believing "new channel will save us" provides false certainty
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Similar: pursuing new AI tools when existing ones aren't fully utilized

**Parallel to AI systems:**
Teams often want new AI agents/tools when they haven't:
- Optimized prompts for existing agents
- Removed context bloat
- Implemented proper memory systems
- Trained team on current tools

The pattern: Seeking novelty instead of optimizing fundamentals.
