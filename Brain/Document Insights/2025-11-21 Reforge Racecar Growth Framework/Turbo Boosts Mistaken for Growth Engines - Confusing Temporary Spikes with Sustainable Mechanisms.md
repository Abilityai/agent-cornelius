## Core Insight

One of the most common growth mistakes is mistaking Turbo Boosts (one-off events that temporarily accelerate growth) for Growth Engines (self-sustaining loops), leading teams to build strategy around non-repeatable tactics.

## Context & Evidence

**From the article - Common Mistake #2:**
"Mistaking Turbo Boosts for a Growth Engine: Confusing temporary spikes with sustainable growth mechanisms. Building strategy around non-repeatable tactics."

**Turbo Boost examples:**
- PR campaigns
- Events and conferences
- Super Bowl ads
- Launch promotions

**Key characteristic:** These provide short-term growth acceleration but are not sustainable long-term strategies.

**Why this mistake happens:**
Teams see a spike in metrics after a PR campaign or event and assume they've found their growth engine. They allocate resources expecting repeatable results, but the spike fades and doesn't compound.

**The confusion:**
- Turbo Boosts: One-time input → Temporary spike → Return to baseline
- Growth Engines: Continuous input → Output that funds more input → Compounding growth

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Finding a confirmation of the belief creates a spike of Dopamine]] - Seeing growth spike confirms "this works" belief, creating dopamine-reinforced false pattern
- [[Pattern completion creates illusion of understanding]] - Mind completes pattern "growth spike = growth engine" without testing sustainability
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Similar confusion: temporary productivity boost from AI tool mistaken for sustainable transformation
- [[Intelligence Points - Discrete Decision Nodes in Process Flows]] - Distinguishing sustainable from temporary requires judgment at key decision points
