## Core Insight

Growth follows an S-curve pattern, requiring fundamentally different strategies at different stages. Applying early-stage tactics to mature products (or vice versa) leads to resource waste and strategic failure.

## Context & Evidence

**From the article - The Growth S-Curve:**

**Early stage:** Focus on finding the right engine
- Experimentation with different growth mechanisms
- Testing which engine has potential for self-sustaining growth
- Low volume, high learning

**Growth stage:** Add fuel and lubricants to existing engine
- Scale proven engine with more resources (fuel)
- Optimize efficiency with conversion improvements (lubricants)
- Maximize output from validated mechanism

**Maturity:** May need new engine or significant pivots
- Current engine hitting natural ceiling
- Incremental optimization yields diminishing returns
- Need fundamental mechanism change, not just efficiency gains

**Strategic implication:**
The diagnostic questions change by stage:
- Early: "Which engine works?" (exploration)
- Growth: "How do we maximize this engine?" (exploitation)
- Maturity: "Do we need a new engine or just better lubricants?" (strategic choice)

**Common mistake:**
Mature companies applying early-stage tactics (constantly searching for new engines) when they should optimize existing ones. Or early-stage companies over-optimizing before validating their engine.

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[Intelligence-First Systems Crystallize Into Workflow-First Components]] - Similar lifecycle: exploration → exploitation → crystallization
- [[The Intelligence Point Audit Framework - Process Design Method]] - Hybrid intelligence points crystallize over time (similar S-curve)
- [[Pattern completion creates illusion of understanding]] - Teams pattern-match to wrong stage, applying inappropriate tactics
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Companies at different AI maturity stages need different strategies

**Parallel to AI agent development:**
- **Early stage:** Testing different agent architectures (finding the engine)
- **Growth stage:** Scaling proven agents, optimizing context windows (fuel + lubricants)
- **Maturity:** Crystallizing agents into workflows or building new agent types (pivot decision)
