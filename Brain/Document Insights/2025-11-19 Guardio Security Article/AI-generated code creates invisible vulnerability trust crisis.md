## Core Insight

"Vibe coding" tools generate functional code that works (passes user testing) but contains invisible security vulnerabilities. This creates a unique trust crisis: developers can verify FUNCTIONALITY through testing but cannot easily verify SECURITY without specialized tools. The gap between "it works" and "it's secure" becomes invisibly wide.

## Context & Evidence

**Market reality**:
- AI coding tools enable rapid website/app creation
- Users can test if features work (visible)
- Security flaws remain invisible until exploited
- Guardio found "significant security gaps" in AI-generated sites after deployment

**The verification asymmetry**:
- **Functionality**: Immediately verifiable (click button → it works)
- **Security**: Requires expertise, tools, attack simulation
- **Result**: Developers trust code because functionality passes, missing security layer

**Lovable case study**:
- Platform allows AI-generated website creation
- Reports highlighted security gaps
- Only THEN integrated Guardio scanning
- Pattern: Discover vulnerability → react (not proactive)

## Connections to Knowledge Base

- [[LLMs can confidently make mistakes - hallucinations create accountability problem]] - AI generates plausible but flawed code
- [[Confirmation bias shapes AI agent evaluation just like human relationships]] - If code works, we assume it's good
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - "Builders" may lack security expertise to verify AI code
- [[AI failure reflects human articulation failure not AI limitation]] - Prompts don't specify "generate SECURE code"
- [[Recreation beats comprehension]] - Regenerating code without understanding security implications

## Unique Angle

**What makes this distinctive**:

Traditional security problems:
- ❌ Developer writes bad code (human error)
- ❌ Developer knows vulnerability exists but ships anyway (negligence)

AI-generated code problem:
- ✅ **Invisible to creator**: Developer can't assess security without specialized knowledge
- ✅ **Functionality masks vulnerability**: Working features create false confidence
- ✅ **Verification gap**: Testing confirms "it works" but not "it's secure"
- ✅ **Democratized deployment**: Non-experts ship production code

**The psychological trap**:

1. **Prompt**: "Build me a user authentication system"
2. **AI generates**: Functional code that handles login/logout
3. **Developer tests**: Login works, logout works ✓
4. **Confirmation bias**: "It works" → "It's good" → "Ship it"
5. **Reality**: SQL injection vulnerability, weak password hashing, session fixation risk
6. **Developer state**: Genuinely unaware of flaws

**Why this matters**:

This is fundamentally different from human-written bad code:
- Human might KNOW they're cutting corners
- AI-assisted developer genuinely believes code is production-ready
- **Trust without comprehension**: The code works, so I trust it's complete

**The "builders not coders" vulnerability**:

As companies shift from "coders" (who understand security) to "builders" (who use AI tools), the population deploying code has LESS security expertise, not more. The knowledge gap widens exactly when AI lowers the barrier to deployment.

## Synthesis Opportunity

This connects to Eugene's broader theme: **AI adoption creates new psychological vulnerabilities**

- **Identity crisis**: "I'm a builder" means less security identity
- **Dopamine trap**: Fast deployment feels good (immediate reward) vs. security audit (delayed, effortful)
- **Pattern completion**: "Works" triggers completion, mind stops searching for flaws
- **Trust crisis**: How do you trust what you can't comprehend?

**Potential framework**: **The Verification Gap in AI-Assisted Creation**
- Functionality verification: Immediate, obvious
- Quality verification: Requires domain expertise
- Security verification: Requires specialized expertise
- As AI democratizes creation, verification gap widens
