## Insight

"It seems like many providers of LLMs like Google whose Gemini enabled a sort of a wait mechanism for client requests. What I'm noticing is that at the hot times of the day I have to wait for longer for the Gemini to respond which probably means that my request is sitting somewhere in the queue point. I'm making here is that it seems like we're going to be restricted by the amount of GPUs we have and the demand is going to be higher than the supply on that side which means that we're going to be waiting in the queue and people will be ready to pay for the priority within this queue."

**Scarcity returns**: LLM infrastructure is becoming capacity-constrained. Queue-based allocation is emerging (wait times vary by demand). This creates new scarcity economics: GPU supply < demand → queue-based access → priority pricing. AI will be scarce "at least in the short term."

## Context & Reasoning

Eugene observes direct evidence:

**Current state**:
- Gemini implementing wait mechanisms
- Response times longer during "hot times of the day"
- Even "ultra package" subscribers wait in queues
- "Even being on the ultra package doesn't really help much - you still have to wait longer in the queue"

**Trend projection**:
- "My prediction is that it's going to get worse"
- Supply not keeping pace: "They don't seem to be able to add the juice or have algorithmic benefits in LLMs to handle the load"
- Demand accelerating: "The load is going to keep growing and growing very very quickly"
- Result: Growing gap between demand and supply

**Economic implications**:
- Queue priority becomes valuable
- "People will be ready to pay for the priority within this queue"
- Creates tiered access model (beyond just pricing plans)
- Energy costs matter: "Not even talking about energy expenditure"

**Personal response**:
- "That's one of the reasons I'm going to be looking for in-house devices to put my LLM on"
- Local deployment becomes strategic advantage
- Self-sufficiency matters when shared infrastructure saturated

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

**Scarcity economics**:
- **[[Supply and demand]]** - Classic shortage economics emerging for AI
- **[[Resource constraints]]** - GPU compute as limiting factor
- **[[Priority pricing]]** - Queue position becomes tradeable commodity

**Infrastructure bottlenecks**:
- **[[Network effects]]** - More users → worse experience (negative network effect)
- **[[Scaling limits]]** - Can't scale infrastructure fast enough
- **[[Energy constraints]]** - GPU power consumption limits
- **[[Moore's Law]]** - Hardware improvement not keeping pace with demand

**Access models**:
- **[[Rationing]]** - Queue-based allocation is form of rationing
- **[[Tiered access]]** - Premium users get queue priority
- **[[Platform economics]]** - Platform controls scarce resource

**Strategic responses**:
- **[[Vertical integration]]** - Running own infrastructure (local LLMs)
- **[[Self-sufficiency]]** - Reducing dependence on shared resources
- **[[Optionality]]** - Having backup access methods

## Connection to Other Insights

**Integrates with**:
- **[[Millions of new intelligences exist]]** - More agents = more compute demand
- **[[AI-AI improvement loop]]** - AI improving AI increases overall demand
- **[[Intellectual chains]]** - Multi-stage pipelines multiply compute requirements
- **[[Recreation beats comprehension]]** - Regeneration increases compute demand (generating > reading)

**Feedback loop**:
- More AI capability → more use cases
- More use cases → more demand
- More demand → infrastructure saturation
- Saturation → scarcity pricing
- Scarcity → local deployment
- Local deployment → fragmentation

## Uniqueness

**What makes this distinctive:**
- Direct observation of scarcity emerging in real-time
- Prediction it will worsen (contrarian to "infinite compute" narrative)
- Recognition that premium pricing doesn't solve (queue still exists)
- Personal strategic response (in-house deployment)

**Counter-narrative**:
- Most AI discussion assumes abundant access
- Eugene observes constraints emerging NOW
- "At least in the short term" suggests temporary but significant

**Economic shift**:
- From: API access democratized
- To: Queue-based rationing with priority pricing
- From: Infinite scale cloud narrative
- To: GPU scarcity and local deployment

**Energy awareness**:
- "Not even talking about energy expenditure"
- Acknowledges physical limits
- AI growth constrained by real-world resources
