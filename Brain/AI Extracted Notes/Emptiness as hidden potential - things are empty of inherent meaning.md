**Core Insight**:

Things and people are inherently empty of meaning; our perspective is what gives them flavor. Because things are empty in essence, they contain a hidden potential of what we can make of them.

**Context & Reasoning**:

This is a Buddhist concept that reframes "emptiness" (śūnyatā) as potential rather than nihilism. Nothing is universally good or bad - if it were, it would be the same for everyone. The fact that experiences vary across people reveals that objects/events don't have fixed qualities. This emptiness isn't absence but **possibility** - the capacity to be shaped by perception and action.

**Key mechanism**: Emptiness → Potential → Shaped by imprints/perspective → Becomes experiential reality

This connects to reference frames and perception: reality filters through cognitive structures, but those structures are malleable.
