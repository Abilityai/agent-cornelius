## Core Insight

Ritual design principle - recurrence makes participation feel like breathing, not choice. Three-part formula for community retention.

## Context & Reasoning

The three-part design formula for lasting community engagement:

1. **Make Participation Inevitable**: Structure rituals with such high frequency and low friction that participating becomes automatic. Daily check-ins, weekly meetings, recurring patterns that embed into life rhythm. Not a conscious choice but a reflex.

2. **Make Leaving Impossible**: Create social, emotional, and identity costs for departure. Shared secrets, public commitments, reputation stakes, interlocking relationships. Leaving requires severing multiple bonds simultaneously.

3. **Make Staying Meaningful**: Ensure continued participation provides genuine value - growth, connection, status, purpose. The inevitable participation and impossible leaving only work if staying delivers on promises.

This is ritual design at its core: transform choice into inevitability, create exit costs, deliver continuous value. Religious communities have perfected this formula over millennia.
