**Type:** Contrarian View / Paradox

## Insight

"Nobody gets fired for buying IBM" represents choosing the safe option to guarantee no blame if things go wrong. This mindset is the fastest way to kill progress. The irony: **the same risk-averse mindset that makes people feel "secure" is what makes them replaceable.** People default to "safe" decisions not because they fear failure, but because they don't feel personally invested ("I don't own this place, I just work here").

## Reframe

The real metric of success shouldn't be:
- "Nobody got fired for buying IBM"

It should be:
- "Nobody got fired for taking a well-reasoned risk that drove real progress"
- "Nobody got fired for believing in innovation over inertia"
- "Nobody got fired for challenging the status quo"

**Core paradox:** The real risk isn't trying something new. It's doing the same thing over and over… and expecting to stay relevant.

## Context

This connects to organizational culture and psychological safety: when people don't have **radical ownership**, they optimize for personal safety (CYA) rather than company progress. The "IBM mentality" is symptomatic of low ownership.

The link to replaceability is crucial: if your value is "making safe decisions anyone would make," you're not differentiated. AI can make "safe, conventional" choices—your value is in conviction and well-reasoned risk-taking.

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

Integrates with:
- **Radical Ownership** - ownership vs. employment mindset
- **Principal-agent problem** - when agents optimize for their interests, not principal's
- **Innovation vs. Imitation** - safe choices = imitation
- **Antifragility** (Taleb) - avoiding all risk makes systems fragile
- **Survivorship bias** - companies that "played it safe" are no longer here to tell their story
- **Risk-taking as skill** - well-reasoned risk is competence, not recklessness

## Cultural Implication

"That's the kind of culture that builds industry-defining companies" - psychological safety must include safety to take well-reasoned risks, not just safety from taking any risk.
