Growth comes from subtraction, not addition. Subtraction is a higher order concept than addition - you must eliminate before you can properly focus. More variables create randomness; fewer variables enable prediction and control. Innovation is saying no to a thousand things.

## Why This Matters

This inverts conventional scaling wisdom ("add more people, more products, more marketing"). The Frame-Floor-Focus framework requires: (1) Frame = impossible goal, (2) Floor = eliminate everything below new standard, (3) Focus = concentrate on remaining exponential levers. Most people skip step 2 and jump from Frame to Focus, maintaining complexity. Simplicity is achieved through elimination, not optimization of existing complexity.

## Connections

- [[Dopamine]] - Elimination reduces dopamine-driven distraction from "shiny object syndrome"
- [[Flow is a selfless state]] - Subtraction removes self-referential complexity, enabling flow
- [[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]] - Letting go of attachment to current business model mirrors Buddhist non-attachment practice
- [[Once the Goals are set - rest of the projects must be ignored]] - Subtraction is the mechanism for ignoring non-essential projects
- [[The benefits of Focus are immediate and the benefits of Synergies are hypothetical]] - Subtraction eliminates hypothetical synergies to capture immediate focus benefits

## Case Study

Alicia Ault (LevelUp Score) scaled from 10 clients to 8,000 in 12 months by eliminating 90% of offers and focusing on a single scalable pathway. Mark Young generated $50M in new pipeline in 6 weeks after 30 years at $20M by applying elimination-first framework.
