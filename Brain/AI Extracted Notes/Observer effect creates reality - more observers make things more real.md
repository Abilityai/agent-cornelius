# Observer effect creates reality - more observers make things more real

**Type**: Contrarian View / Speculative Theory
**Source**: Personal theory on quantum consciousness
**Uniqueness**: Proposes that reality's "realness" is proportional to number of conscious observers entangled with it - challenges objective reality assumption

**Core Insight**:

"This might also mean that the reality gets more 'real' if there are more people who collaborate with it, who see it and entangle their minds with it. May be the layer of magic and reality manipulation is exactly there, in manipulating things that are barely real, unique in terms of entanglement."

Reality isn't fixed and objective - its solidity/stability depends on how many conscious systems are entangled with it. Things with fewer observers are less "real" and potentially more malleable.

**Context & Reasoning**:

**The Mechanism:**

1. **Individual observation** → Creates entanglement between observer and observed
2. **Multiple observers** → Multiple independent entanglement networks
3. **Consensus reality** → Heavily entangled (many observers) = very stable/fixed
4. **Unique experiences** → Lightly entangled (few observers) = less stable/more malleable

**Spectrum of Realness:**
- **High entanglement** (public, shared reality): Mountain, sun, moon - observed by billions
- **Medium entanglement** (social reality): Cultural constructs, social norms - observed by communities
- **Low entanglement** (private reality): Dreams, thoughts, subtle perceptions - few or single observer
- **Minimal entanglement** (potential reality): Unobserved quantum states, possibilities

**"Magic and reality manipulation":**
The suggestion is that phenomena at the edge of observation (low entanglement) might be more susceptible to influence by consciousness because they're not yet "solidified" by multiple observers.

**Comparison to Established Concepts**:

**Similar to:**
- **Quantum measurement problem:** Observation affects quantum systems
- **Social constructivism:** Reality is partially socially constructed
- **Berkeley's idealism:** "To be is to be perceived"

**Different from:**
- **Objective realism:** Reality exists independently of observation (this challenges that)
- **Pure subjectivism:** This still requires actual entanglement (physical interaction), not just thought

---

**Provocative Implications**:

1. **Historical events:** More observed = more "locked in" (harder to reinterpret)
2. **Social reality:** Cultural constructs gain solidity through collective observation
3. **Personal experiences:** Private perceptions more fluid because fewer observers
4. **Scientific observation:** Measurement literally makes reality more definite
5. **Placebo effects:** Low-entanglement phenomena (subjective states) more malleable

**Most controversial claim:** "Reality manipulation" of barely-observed phenomena

---

**Critical Analysis**:

**Problems:**
1. **No mechanism:** How would mental entanglement differ from physical measurement?
2. **Macro vs. micro:** Quantum observer effects at particle level ≠ macro reality manipulation
3. **Intersubjective agreement:** Doesn't explain why independent observers agree about reality
4. **Testability:** How would we test if something is "more real" with more observers?

**Charitable interpretation:**
This might be pointing at something true about **social construction of meaning** rather than physical reality manipulation. Social norms, cultural values, historical interpretations DO become more "real" (stable, accepted) with more observers/participants.

**Uncharitable interpretation:**
This veers into magical thinking without empirical grounding.

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Consciousness as entanglement network - mind emerges from particles sharing world information]] - Core theory this derives from
- [[Quantum entanglement mirrors Buddhist emptiness - properties exist only in relation]] - Relational reality basis
- [[Emptiness as hidden potential - things are empty of inherent meaning]] - Low entanglement = high potential for meaning-making
- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - Beliefs might "stabilize" low-entanglement phenomena
- [[Once we take a view (perspective, position, belief) we leave something out]] - Each observation "collapses" other possibilities

**Status:** Highly speculative, borders on metaphysics. Interesting thought experiment but requires rigorous development to separate quantum phenomena from magical thinking.
