An impossible goal simplifies everything by becoming a filter for what matters. Bold goals narrow options to only viable paths, while small goals leave everything seeming possible, creating paralysis. The first benefit of a properly set goal is that it eliminates almost all options.

## Why This Matters

This reveals the psychological mechanism behind why "10x thinking" works: constraint drives clarity. A small goal (2x growth) maintains complexity because hundreds of paths could work. An impossible goal (10x in 3 years) kills 99% of options immediately, forcing you to identify the one exponential lever. The paradox: bigger goals are easier to execute because they eliminate decision fatigue through ruthless filtering.

## Connections

- [[Finding a confirmation of belief creates dopamine spike]] - Bold goals may override identity-based resistance through dopamine anticipation of massive achievement
- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - Impossible goals reduce uncertainty by eliminating most pathways
- [[Dopamine]] - The motivational drive from huge goals may create stronger dopamine anticipation than incremental targets
- [[Once the Goals are set - rest of the projects must be ignored]] - Impossible goals operationalize this principle by making elimination automatic
- [[Creativity requires limits, not an empty page]] - Bold goals provide the constraint that enables creative problem-solving

## Examples

College tennis offers hundreds of pathways (recreational, club, intramural, competitive). Professional tennis offers one or two paths (elite training, top tournaments). Higher standards automatically eliminate lower-quality options without deliberation.
