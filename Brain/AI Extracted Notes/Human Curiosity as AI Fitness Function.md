## Core Insight

My interest, my curiosity, right now is the selection function of evolution. These choices we're making is basically a fitness function for those species, those creatures, of agents.

## Context & Reasoning

Human attention and curiosity serve as the evolutionary pressure that determines which AI agents survive and thrive. Just as biological organisms evolved through environmental selection pressures, AI agents are evolving through human choice - what we pay attention to, what we find interesting, what we engage with becomes the fitness function for digital organisms.

This reframes human curiosity not as passive consumption but as active evolutionary force shaping the development of artificial intelligence. Our clicks, our time, our interest literally determines which agents get resources, which get improved, and which fade away.
