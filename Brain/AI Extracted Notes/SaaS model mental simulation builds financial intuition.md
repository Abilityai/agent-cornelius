**Core Insight** (in Eugene's voice):

"Honestly, when I started building YayPay in 2016, it was a challenge for me to understand clearly how the SaaS business works. It took me some time to get comfortable with it. And even now, after becoming an investor and mentor, I continue to learn new ways to look at the metrics of the SaaS business. If I'd a tool like this back then, it would have made my life much easier."

**Context & Reasoning**:

Eugene created a SaaS financial model not just for forecasting, but for **building intuition** through experimentation.

**The Learning Problem**:
- SaaS metrics interconnected (changing one affects many)
- Formulas don't build intuition
- Hard to see second-order effects
- Need to "feel" the dynamics

**Eugene's Tool Enables**:
- **Build intuition** around SaaS metrics and how they're connected
- **Play with numbers** to see how they can be optimized
- **See data on clear charts** (visual learning)
- **Learn industry guidelines** and make changes to meet them

**Key Inputs** (Variables to Experiment With):
- R&D, Sales, G&A spending levels
- ACV (Annual Contract Value)
- Churn Rate
- Client Growth Rate

**Outputs** (30+ Standard SaaS Metrics):
- Runway
- Net Burn
- Gross Margin (%)
- S&M as % of Revenue
- ARPU (MRR/Total Clients)
- CAC
- LTV/CAC
- Burn / MRR

---

**Eugene's Example: Learning Through Failure**:

**Initial Scenario** (Depressing):
- Month 9: Out of money
- MRR growth can't sustain burn
- Long road to break-even
- **Insight**: Initial assumptions don't work

**Second Iteration** (+$300K in Month 7):
- Survive longer
- But still risky (one month runway for extended period)
- **Insight**: Additional funding helps but not enough

**Third Iteration** (+$100K end of year 1):
- Safely cross profitability threshold
- Healthy metrics emerge
- **Insight**: Need multiple funding rounds carefully timed

**Learning Moments**:
- "If we look at another chart that shows the remaining term, a risky picture emerges"
- "Now comes the most challenging part - the actual implementation"
- "Biggest challenge is ensuring we can achieve this growth rate with the assumed marketing spend"

---

**Why This Approach Works**:

**Experiential Learning**:
- See consequences of decisions instantly
- Build causal mental models
- Develop number sense
- Understand interconnections

**Safe Failure**:
- Fail in spreadsheet, not real business
- Test assumptions before committing
- Explore scenarios freely
- Learn what matters most

**Pattern Recognition**:
- How churn affects runway
- How CAC impacts burn rate
- When to raise funding
- What metrics indicate health

**Eugene's Encouragement**:
"If you're relatively new to SaaS, I will encourage you to play with the numbers to better understand how much churn, R&D spend, and other assumptions impact results."
