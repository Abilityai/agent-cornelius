## Core Insight

Propaganda film for sect - embedding cult values through entertainment. Film becomes "core of the earth" for community identity. Creates mythology through media.

## Context & Reasoning

Media serves as foundational mythology for communities, encoding values, beliefs, and identity through narrative rather than direct instruction. The approach:

1. **Entertainment as Trojan Horse**: Wrap community values in engaging story so consumption feels like recreation, not indoctrination.

2. **Core of the Earth**: The media becomes central reference point - members quote it, reference it, derive meaning from it. Shared mythology creates shared language.

3. **Belief Reinforcement**: Stories demonstrate community values in action, making abstract principles concrete and memorable.

4. **Identity Embedding**: Characters model ideal member behavior, giving concrete examples of "people like us."

This is "propaganda" in the neutral sense: media designed to propagate specific worldview. Religious communities use parables. Nations use patriotic films. Companies use case studies. The medium is entertainment, the function is cultural programming.

The insight: Don't just tell members what to believe - create media that SHOWS the worldview in action, making it feel natural and aspirational.
