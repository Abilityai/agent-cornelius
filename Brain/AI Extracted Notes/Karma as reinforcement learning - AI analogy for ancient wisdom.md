**Core Insight**:

If karma was an AI system: it takes actions, memorizes that in this situation it should be more likely to take the same action, and when it encounters similar situations, retrieves this memory and biases the choice toward that option. **Karma operates exactly like reinforcement learning.**

---

**Context & Reasoning**:

This is a **powerful technical analogy** that makes karma mechanistically precise:

**Karma as RL algorithm**:

```
1. State: Current situation/perception
2. Action: Behavior/thought chosen
3. Memory update: Create/strengthen imprint (weight adjustment)
4. Next state: New situation arises
5. Policy retrieval: Access imprints (memory lookup)
6. Action bias: Probability of repeating action increases
7. Repeat: Loop continues
```

**In RL terms**:
- **Imprints** = Policy weights (action probabilities given state)
- **Karma** = Weight updates from past actions
- **Future perception** = State representation shaped by policy
- **Reinforcement** = Repetition strengthens weights
- **Intention** = Learning rate (how much weight changes)

**Why this analogy works**:

**Mechanistic precision**: No mysticism, just probability and memory

**Explains key karma properties**:
- **More you do X, more likely to do X** = Higher weight on that action
- **Imprints accumulate over time** = Weights compound through updates
- **Past shapes future** = Historical actions bias current policy
- **Perception is shaped** = State representation depends on policy

**Makes intervention concrete**:
- **Change karma** = Update policy weights
- **6-time journal** = Monitoring weight updates
- **Intentional action** = High learning rate updates
- **Mindfulness** = Observing policy without execution

**Example walkthrough**:

**Situation**: Colleague criticizes your work

**RL/Karma process**:
1. **State**: "Criticism received"
2. **Memory retrieval**: Access imprints from past criticism situations
3. **Action probabilities**:
   - If past action = defensiveness → High probability of defensiveness
   - If past action = curiosity → High probability of curiosity
4. **Action taken**: Respond based on weighted probabilities
5. **Memory update**: Current action strengthens its weight for future
6. **Next time**: Even higher probability of repeating action

**The key insight**: **You're training yourself like an AI model**

Every action is a training example.
Every situation is a forward pass.
Every imprint is a weight update.
Your life is the training data.

**This makes karma:PRACTICAL**:

**For technical minds**: "Oh, I'm running gradient descent on my behavior policy"

**For everyone**: Concrete mechanism replacing vague "cosmic justice" framing

**Differences from mystical karma**:
- ❌ No cosmic ledger of good/bad
- ❌ No external judge or punishment
- ✅ Self-updating system
- ✅ Probabilistic, not deterministic
- ✅ Changeable through intentional action

**Extends to**:

**Identity**: Identity = Policy for "who I am" domain
**Habits**: Habits = High-weight actions in autopilot mode
**Learning**: Learning = Intentional policy updates
**Perception**: Perception = State representation learned from policy

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Imprints create future perception - past actions shape how we see the world]] - Imprints as policy weights
- [[Identity-action reinforcement loop]] - Identity as policy for self-domain
- [[Learning is purposeful imprint planting]] - Learning as intentional weight updates
- [[Intention amplifies imprints]] - Intention as learning rate
- [[Habits]] - Habits as high-weight autopilot actions
- [[AI]] - Direct technical bridge to machine learning
- [[Dopamine is responsible for Motivation to do anything]] - Dopamine as reward signal in RL
- [[Confirmation Bias]] - Policy bias toward confirming evidence
- [[Action freedom vs perception constraint]] - Current action = policy update; perception = state representation
