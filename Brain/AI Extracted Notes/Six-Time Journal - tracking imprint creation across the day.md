**Core Insight**:

6-Time Journal - track positive and negative specific examples of imprints you are putting throughout the day. Regular check-ins create awareness of what perceptual patterns you're creating.

---

**Context & Reasoning**:

This is a **specific accountability system** from The Diamond Cutter framework:

**The practice**:
- **Frequency**: 6 times per day
- **Content**: Specific examples of actions/thoughts creating imprints
- **Categories**: Positive imprints vs. negative imprints
- **Purpose**: Build meta-awareness of imprint creation process

**Why 6 times matters**:
- Catches patterns before they become unconscious
- Roughly every 2-3 waking hours (maintains awareness)
- Creates feedback loop (awareness → conscious choice → better imprints)
- Prevents end-of-day rationalization (captures in-the-moment truth)

**What to track** (from source's imprint categories):
- Anger/aggression (negative) vs. patience/peace (positive)
- Gratitude moments (positive)
- Compassion/love actions (positive)
- Selfless help given (positive)
- Seeing others as self (positive) vs. othering (negative)
- Truthfulness (positive) vs. lies (negative)
- Meaningful speech (positive) vs. gossip (negative)
- Pride/jealousy (negative) vs. humility/appreciation (positive)

**Mechanism**:
1. **Awareness** - Noticing what imprints you're creating
2. **Accountability** - Knowing you'll journal it later changes behavior
3. **Pattern recognition** - Seeing recurring negative imprints
4. **Intention strengthening** - Positive examples reinforce beneficial patterns
5. **Course correction** - Adjusting behavior based on journal data

This parallels:
- **Habit tracking** - Awareness drives change
- **CBT thought records** - Documenting patterns to shift them
- **Quantified self** - Data-driven behavior modification
- **Mindfulness check-ins** - Regular present-moment awareness
