## Core Insight

Nations don't form without external enemies. The enemy can be abstract (a task, a problem to solve). This was the missing component in community design.

## Context & Reasoning

Communities cohere around shared opposition, not just shared interests. Nations form against external threats. Religious groups define themselves against heretics. Political movements unite against common enemies. The pattern is universal: identity crystallizes through contrast with "the other."

The enemy doesn't have to be human - it can be:
- **Abstract**: A problem to solve (poverty, disease, ignorance)
- **Conceptual**: A wrong to right (injustice, inefficiency)
- **Competitive**: A challenge to overcome (market position, technical frontier)

The insight for community design: many attempts fail because they focus only on what members are FOR (shared values, interests) without creating what they're AGAINST. The opposition gives purpose, urgency, and boundary definition.
