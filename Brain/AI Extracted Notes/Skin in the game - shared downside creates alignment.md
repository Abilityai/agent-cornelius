**Core Insight** (in Eugene's voice):

"Only work with and trust people who share the downside with you. That means they have something to lose if you don't win. It could be money, a public image, or something else if it's important to them. But it must be there."

"This is important because it's the only way you can force someone to be in the same boat with you and strive toward a common goal. Or, in other words, to have Skin in the game. 💸"

**Context & Reasoning**:

Eugene argues that **downside sharing** (not just upside) is what creates true alignment and motivation.

**Why Downside Matters More Than Upside**:

**The Free Bet Problem (Eugene's Founder Example)**:
"Founders find an important team member and immediately give them shares. Not options to be vested, just straight equity. The reason is that it's a free bet for that person. The only thing they risk in this case is the opportunity cost (i.e., they could do something else instead)."

Result:
- "They can work for a while to see if it's going in the right direction and then leave if they don't think it's"
- "It's not a loss for them. And believe me, they'll always have it in the back of their mind"
- "They may not put all the effort into the project either - why should they? They've nothing to lose, only to gain"

**Loss Aversion Connection**:
"People are much more motivated to avoid losses than to make gains (we'll talk about Loss Aversion bias and Prospect Theory later)."

**The Contractor Problem**:
"If you hire partners to build something for you, and they charge you on an hourly or project basis, they don't care if your project will be successful. Why should they? They get their profit anyway. And that drives their daily decisions. All they want is their immediate profit - and for you, that means lowering quality, extending schedule, etc."

**The Service Provider Problem**:
"If you order a service that's no interest in you using it over and over again, you should never pay for it upfront. If you pay them only after the work is done, they'll at least share in the downside of a bad job."

**Eugene's Decision Framework**:

**When deciding to work with someone:**
- As business partner
- As key employee
- As contractor with high dependency

**Structure collaboration so they have:**
- ✅ Big, shiny carrot of future success (upside)
- ✅ **Consequences of failure (downside)** ← This is critical

**Why This Works**:
"Those who always have people around them fighting for their interests become really successful. And this is only possible if they share the downside ❗"

**Practical Mechanisms for Shared Downside**:
- Vesting schedules (not immediate equity)
- Performance-based compensation
- Payment after delivery
- Reputation risk (public association with success/failure)
- Long-term contracts with penalties
- Clawback provisions
