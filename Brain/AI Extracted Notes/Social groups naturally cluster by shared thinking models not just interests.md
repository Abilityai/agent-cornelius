# Social groups naturally cluster by shared thinking models not just interests

People naturally group not just by interests but by the cognitive frameworks they use - what thinking methods and mental models they apply to problems, and how they tend to see the world. Interests are symptoms of shared epistemological approaches.

## Connections
- [[Mental Models Taxonomy]] - the frameworks people share
- [[Reference Frames create reality]] - thinking patterns shape perception
- [[Identity is a set of beliefs]] - cognitive frameworks as identity markers

## Insight Type
Pattern Recognition / Synthesis

## What Makes This Unique
Reframes social clustering from interest-based to cognitive-framework-based. Suggests interests are just surface manifestations of deeper thinking patterns.
