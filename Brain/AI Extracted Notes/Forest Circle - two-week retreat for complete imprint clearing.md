**Core Insight**:

Forest Circle - a 2-week retreat where you spend time in isolation and follow certain contemplation program. This allows clearing the mind completely and making important decisions to which you must stick after the retreat.

---

**Context & Reasoning**:

This is the **most intensive practice** in The Diamond Cutter system:

**The practice**:
- **Duration**: 2 weeks (14 days)
- **Setting**: Isolation (forest/nature implied)
- **Activities**: Contemplation program (structured)
- **Purposes**:
  1. Complete mind clearing (deep imprint reset)
  2. Major decision-making (with clarity)
  3. Commitment creation (decisions must be followed after)

**Why 2 weeks matters**:
- **Week 1**: Detachment from daily reactive patterns, withdrawal from external imprint reinforcement
- **Week 2**: Deep clearing achieved, new clarity emerges, decisions from clear state
- Longer than typical meditation retreats (which often are 7-10 days)
- Allows complete nervous system reset

**Why isolation matters**:
- Removes external validation/invalidation of existing imprints
- No social reinforcement of identity-linked beliefs
- Breaks automatic reaction loops
- Forces confrontation with unexamined patterns

**The mechanism**:
1. **Removal from environment** - Stops reinforcement of existing imprints
2. **Sustained practice** - Weakens automatic patterns through non-engagement
3. **Contemplation** - Examines imprints without acting on them
4. **Clarity emerges** - Seeing reality without habitual filters
5. **Decision from clarity** - Choices made without distorting imprints
6. **Commitment** - Decisions have weight because made from clear state

**Post-retreat requirement**:
"Must stick to decisions after retreat" - implies:
- Decisions made in clarity are binding
- Return to normal environment will test commitment
- Clarity-based choices override reactive patterns
- Retreat creates leverage for life change

This parallels:
- **Meditation retreats** (Vipassana, Zen sesshins) - intensive practice for breakthrough
- **Vision quests** (indigenous traditions) - isolation for clarity
- **Sabbaticals** - Extended time away for perspective reset
- **Psychedelic therapy** - Temporary state change enabling pattern reset

**Integration with other practices**:
- **Morning Circle** (daily) - maintains imprint awareness
- **6-Time Journal** (daily) - tracks imprint creation
- **Evening Circle** (weekly) - regular contemplation
- **Forest Circle** (periodic) - deep reset and major decisions
