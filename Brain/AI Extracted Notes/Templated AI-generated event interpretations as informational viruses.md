# Templated AI-generated event interpretations as informational viruses

Rapid creation of event interpretations through templated AI video generation could function as measurable "informational viruses." Testing viral potential on TikTok/Instagram would reveal dynamics of reality manipulation and perceived-reality change at scale.

## Connections
- [[Reality creation will become the next competitive lever for shaping humanity]] - the overarching framework
- [[Social Media uses Intermittent Variable Reinforcement (IVR)]] - the distribution mechanism
- [[Uncertain Cue gives a higher Dopamine reward than certain one]] - why ambiguous content spreads
- [[AI agents are digital organisms with fitness functions]] - the production tools

## Insight Type
Personal Theory / Synthesis

## What Makes This Unique
Proposes using AI video generation with interpretation templates to launch and measure "informational viruses" - systematic reality manipulation experiments with viral metrics.
