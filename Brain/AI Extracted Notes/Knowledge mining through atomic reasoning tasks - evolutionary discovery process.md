**Core Insight** (in author's voice):

What if we find a set of identical atomic thinking tasks which we can check whether they are solved or not and sort of mine knowledge. Conclusions. Logic. And then look at the one that makes sense and do it again. And so in a chain until we get some new conclusions and discoveries. And you can automatically tune prompts evolutionarily. And see where it goes.

**Context & Reasoning**:

This describes a **systematic methodology for AI-driven knowledge discovery** through iterative reasoning chains:

**The Core Process**:

1. **Define atomic reasoning tasks** - Smallest verifiable thinking units
   - Must be checkable (solved or not solved)
   - Must be repeatable (identical structure)
   - Must be combinable (chain-able)

2. **Execute task set** - Run AI on atomic tasks
   - Generate multiple reasoning attempts
   - Verify which ones solved correctly
   - Filter for meaningful outputs

3. **Select meaningful results** - Quality filter
   - Identify which solutions "make sense"
   - Distinguish signal from noise
   - Extract insights from successful chains

4. **Iterate in chains** - Build on discoveries
   - Use successful results as input for next round
   - Chain atomic tasks into complex reasoning
   - Discover emergent patterns

5. **Evolutionary prompt tuning** - Meta-optimization
   - Automatically adjust prompts based on success
   - Optimize for meaningful output
   - Let the system evolve toward better reasoning

6. **Explore emergent behavior** - "See where it goes"
   - Don't predetermine endpoints
   - Allow novel discoveries
   - Follow unexpected patterns

**What makes this unique**:

**Atomic + Verifiable**:
- Unlike open-ended generation, tasks are CHECKABLE
- Binary success criteria (solved/not solved)
- Enables quality filtering at scale

**Mining metaphor**:
- Like crypto mining: Process many attempts, keep valuable ones
- Unlike human reasoning: Parallelizable, exhaustive, systematic
- Creates knowledge through iteration not insight

**Evolutionary aspect**:
- Prompts adapt based on what produces meaningful results
- System learns what works without manual tuning
- Natural selection of reasoning patterns

**Chain discovery**:
- Individual tasks may be simple
- Chains create complexity
- Novel conclusions emerge from combinations

**Applications**:

**AI Agent Reasoning**:
- [[Context engineering replaces prompt engineering]] - This takes it further: EVOLUTIONARY context
- Automated theorem proving
- Systematic hypothesis generation
- Logical inference chains

**Knowledge Base Growth**:
- Mine connections between existing notes
- Generate synthesis insights automatically
- Discover non-obvious logical chains
- [[Knowledge graph]] expansion through reasoning

**Scientific Discovery**:
- Hypothesis generation at scale
- Automated literature synthesis
- Pattern discovery in data
- Logical inference from facts

**Prompt Engineering**:
- Instead of manual prompt crafting: Evolutionary optimization
- Test thousands of prompt variations
- Select based on meaningful output
- Continuous improvement loop

**Challenges & Limitations**:

1. **Defining "meaningful"** - What makes a result valuable?
2. **Task atomicity** - How small is "atomic"?
3. **Verification criteria** - How to check if solved?
4. **Computational cost** - Mining requires many attempts
5. **Emergent direction** - Hard to predict where it goes

**Comparison to existing methods**:

| Traditional AI | This Method |
|----------------|-------------|
| Single-shot generation | Iterative mining |
| Manual prompt tuning | Evolutionary optimization |
| Open-ended output | Verifiable tasks |
| Human-guided | System-guided exploration |
| Predefined goals | Emergent discovery |
