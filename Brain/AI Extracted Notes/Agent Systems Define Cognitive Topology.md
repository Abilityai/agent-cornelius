# Agent Systems Define Cognitive Topology

Agentic systems don't just assist thinking - they define the topology of thought itself. Different agent architectures optimize for different cognitive patterns, which users then adopt as their natural thinking style.

**Examples of cognitive shaping:**
- **Agent A (optimized for speed)** → User develops impatient, rapid-fire thinking
- **Agent B (optimized for depth)** → User becomes more contemplative, slower to conclude
- **Agent C (optimized for novelty)** → User develops novelty-seeking, contrarian tendencies

**McLuhan extension:** "We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us" - but now tools are intelligence amplifiers, so the reshaping is cognitive, not just behavioral.

The architecture choices made by agent designers (context window size, retrieval strategies, reasoning depth, speed-accuracy tradeoffs) become the cognitive constraints and affordances adopted by users. We're outsourcing not just tasks but thinking patterns.

**Critical insight:** The Folder Paradigm isn't just about agent memory - it's about which cognitive patterns get reinforced through repeated use. The agent's "fitness function" becomes the user's optimization target.

**Connections:**
- [[The Folder Paradigm - Agents own directories as operational memory]] - Architecture shapes cognition
- [[Context engineering replaces prompt engineering]] - Engineering thought topology, not just queries
- [[Mental Models are Lenses Biases and Tools]] - Agents as external mental models
- [[Dopamine Optimization Protocol]] - Agents optimized for dopamine create addictive thinking
- [[Cognitive Infrastructure Selection as Identity Formation]] - Adopted topology becomes identity

**Questions Raised:**
- Are certain cognitive topologies healthier than others?
- Should there be ethical guidelines for agent cognitive shaping?
- Can users switch between topologies or does prolonged use create lock-in?
