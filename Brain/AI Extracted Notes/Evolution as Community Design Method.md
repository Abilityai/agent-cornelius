## Core Insight

Launch multiple communities with different rules, let them compete. Extract successful patterns. Don't design the perfect solution - design selection mechanisms and let evolution find it.

## Context & Reasoning

The evolutionary approach to community design rejects the "perfect blueprint" mindset. Instead:

1. **Generate Variation**: Launch multiple communities with different rule sets, structures, rituals, and incentive mechanisms.

2. **Apply Selection Pressure**: Let communities compete for members, engagement, retention. Natural selection through user choice.

3. **Extract Patterns**: Observe which communities thrive, which die. Identify successful mechanisms, not whole systems.

4. **Iterate**: Apply lessons to new generation of communities with refined variations.

This mirrors biological evolution: don't engineer the perfect organism, create conditions for evolution and let fitness functions select winners. The designer's role shifts from architect to gardener - creating environments where successful forms emerge.

Key insight: The selection mechanism IS the design. You're not designing communities, you're designing the fitness landscape that shapes communities.
