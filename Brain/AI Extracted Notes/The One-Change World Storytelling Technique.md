## Core Insight

Everything like our world except one small thing. Creates believability and connection. Not wild space opera - subtle alterations to reality.

## Context & Reasoning

The storytelling technique that maximizes relatability while exploring ideas: start with the familiar world, change ONE thing, explore consequences.

**Why it works:**
- **Believability**: 99% familiar creates trust and grounding
- **Connection**: Audience recognizes their world, projects into it
- **Focus**: Single change allows deep exploration without distraction
- **Thought experiment**: Isolates variable like scientific experiment

**Examples:**
- What if AI could read thoughts? (everything else normal)
- What if aging stopped at 30? (everything else normal)
- What if sleep wasn't needed? (everything else normal)

This contrasts with "wild space opera" where everything is different - alien worlds, different physics, unrelatable contexts. The one-change world keeps the reference frame intact while shifting a single parameter.

The technique is essentially controlled experimentation in narrative form: hold all variables constant except one, observe outcomes.
