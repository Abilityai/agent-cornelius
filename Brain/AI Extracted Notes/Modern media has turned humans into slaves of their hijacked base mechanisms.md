Human psychology is now systematically hacked by media exploiting base neurological mechanisms (dopamine, uncertainty, confirmation bias). People have become slaves to systems that weaponize their cognitive architecture. The exploitation is comprehensive and structural, not accidental.

- [[Uncertain Cue gives a higher Dopamine reward than certain one]] - uncertainty weaponization
- [[Duhkha is craving that leads to suffering]] - Buddhist parallel
- [[AI-generated media destroys shared reality anchors forcing reliance on loudest voices]] - consequence
