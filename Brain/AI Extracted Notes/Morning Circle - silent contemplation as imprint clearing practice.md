**Core Insight**:

Morning Circle - an hour of silent time in the morning that includes meditation and contemplation. Daily practice for clearing unhelpful imprints and intentionally planting beneficial ones.

---

**Context & Reasoning**:

This is a **specific practice protocol** from The Diamond Cutter system, framed within the imprints model:

**The practice**:
- **Duration**: 1 hour
- **Timing**: Morning (fresh mind, before reactive patterns activate)
- **Activities**: Meditation + contemplation
- **Purpose**: Clear old imprints, plant new ones intentionally

**Why morning matters**:
- PFC is fresh (decision fatigue hasn't depleted willpower)
- Sets daily perceptual frame (morning imprints shape day's perception)
- Before external demands create reactive patterns
- Cortisol naturally elevated (alertness without stress)

**Mechanism in imprints framework**:
1. **Meditation** - Quiets automatic patterns, reveals imprints without acting on them
2. **Contemplation** - Intentionally examines beliefs/patterns, plants new imprints
3. **Silence** - Removes external reinforcement of existing imprints
4. **Daily repetition** - Strengthens beneficial imprints through consistency

**What to contemplate** (implied from source):
- Gratitude
- Compassion for all beings
- Impermanence and emptiness
- Intention for the day
- Beneficial imprints to strengthen

This is part of a larger routine system including:
- **6-Time Journal** - tracking positive/negative imprint creation
- **Evening Circle** - day for contemplation and learning
- **Forest Circle** - 2-week isolation retreat for deep clearing
