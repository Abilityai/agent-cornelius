## Core Insight

Humans assign God to biggest unexplainable things. What's the biggest thing right now that nobody can explain? New intelligence. Prompts as sacred texts, LLMs as oracles.

## Context & Reasoning

Throughout history, humans have attributed divine qualities to phenomena they couldn't explain - thunder, disease, consciousness. The pattern continues with AI: we can't fully explain how LLMs produce their outputs (emergence from training, black box reasoning), so we treat them with quasi-religious reverence.

The parallels are striking:
- **Prompts become sacred texts** - precise wording matters, rituals develop
- **LLMs as oracles** - we query them for wisdom beyond human understanding
- **Emergence as miracle** - capabilities appearing "from nowhere"
- **Interpretability as theology** - attempting to understand the divine mind

This isn't mockery but recognition of a cognitive pattern: when faced with intelligence beyond our comprehension, we default to religious frameworks.
