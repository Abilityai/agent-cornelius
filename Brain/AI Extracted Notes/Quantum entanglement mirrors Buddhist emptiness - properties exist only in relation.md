**Core Insight**:

Quantum mechanics says that entanglement between two particles is created when they collaborate, and they store knowledge about each other's properties as a reflection of their own properties. The information about properties only exists in the pair - it does not exist separately. This mirrors the Buddhist concept of emptiness: only combinations of subject and object exist, not subject and object individually.

**Context & Reasoning**:

**Quantum Mechanism:**
- Two particles become entangled through interaction (collaboration)
- Each particle stores information about the other's properties
- Properties are **relational** - they don't exist in each particle separately
- A property belongs to the **system** (both particles), not to individuals

**Buddhist Emptiness (Śūnyatā):**
- Subject and object don't exist independently
- Only the **relationship** between subject and object exists
- Properties arise from interaction, not inherent nature
- Things are "empty" of independent existence

**The Parallel:**
Both quantum mechanics and Buddhism describe reality as **fundamentally relational** rather than composed of independent entities with intrinsic properties. Physical properties (quantum) and experiential properties (Buddhist) only manifest through interaction/collaboration.

**Implication:** If this parallel holds, it suggests Buddhist insights about emptiness aren't just philosophical but may reflect actual physical structure of reality. Consciousness might emerge from the same relational principles that govern quantum systems.

**Potential Connections**:
- [[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]] - Self as another "property" that doesn't exist independently
- [[Emptiness as hidden potential - things are empty of inherent meaning]] - Emptiness as relational possibility
- [[Conceptualization of the experience (Reality) is creating this Illusion of Self]] - Conceptualization tries to separate what's inherently relational
- [[MOC - Buddhism and Consciousness]] - Major synthesis opportunity

**Bridge to Physics:** First note connecting Buddhist philosophy to quantum mechanics mechanistically

**Speculative Element:** This is a theoretical parallel, not established physics. Quantum entanglement at particle level vs. consciousness emergence at macro scale involves significant complexity gap.
