# Reality creation will become the next competitive lever for shaping humanity

The next major competition will be over reality creation capabilities - using AI agents and systems to shape perceived reality for large groups. This extends media's role but with agentic automation, making reality manipulation a programmable, scalable instrument for controlling human trajectory.
