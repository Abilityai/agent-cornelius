**Core Insight**:

We decide how to act based on what our identity-Self would do. We see the world through the perspective of this Self. **This identity is built based on the actions done before.** That's why the more we do something, the more likely we are to do it again - identity creates actions that strengthen identity.

---

**Context & Reasoning**:

This makes the **identity-action feedback loop** mechanistically explicit:

**The loop**:
1. **Identity determines action** - "What would someone like me do?"
2. **Action creates imprint** - Behavior leaves perceptual/behavioral pattern
3. **Imprint reinforces identity** - "I'm the kind of person who does X"
4. **Strengthened identity** → More likely to repeat action
5. **Loop continues** - Self-perpetuating cycle

**Why this is powerful**:

**Explains behavioral persistence**: Not just habits (unconscious) but identity (conscious self-concept)

**Shows double reinforcement**:
- **Imprints** strengthen perceptual patterns (how you see situations)
- **Identity** strengthens behavioral patterns (how you respond to situations)

**Reveals trap**: Identity feels stable because it creates the actions that confirm it

**Examples**:

**Professional identity**:
- "I'm an engineer" → Take engineering approach to problems → Strengthen engineering identity → See more problems as engineering challenges → Cycle continues

**Social identity**:
- "I'm introverted" → Avoid social situations → Strengthen introverted identity → See social situations as draining → Cycle continues

**Moral identity**:
- "I'm honest" → Choose truthful action → Strengthen honest identity → Notice opportunities for honesty → Cycle continues

**The mechanism connects to**:

**Buddhism**: [[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]] - The self is this loop mistaken for a fixed entity

**Dopamine**: [[Finding a confirmation of the belief creates a spike of Dopamine]] - Each identity-confirming action triggers dopamine, neurologically rewarding the loop

**Habit formation**: Habits are unconscious loops; identity loops are conscious but equally self-reinforcing

**The difference from existing Identity note**:

Existing note: "Identity shapes beliefs and behavior"
This insight: "**Identity → Action → Identity** (closes the feedback loop)"

The loop explains:
- Why identity is so stable (self-reinforcing)
- Why identity change is so hard (requires breaking loop)
- How to change identity (interrupt action → weaken reinforcement)

**Breaking the loop**:
1. **Notice the loop** - Awareness that identity is driving action
2. **Question identity-action link** - "Must I do this because I'm X?"
3. **Choose identity-inconsistent action** - Act contrary to identity
4. **Observe identity weakening** - Notice self-concept becoming flexible
5. **Create new loop** - Intentionally design identity through action selection

This parallels:
- **CBT** - Behavior change precedes belief change
- **Acting as if** - Fake it till you make it (new actions create new identity)
- **Identity-based habits** (James Clear) - Design actions that vote for desired identity

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Identity]] - Expands existing note with explicit loop mechanism
- [[Imprints create future perception - past actions shape how we see the world]] - Identity as one type of imprint (self-concept)
- [[Finding a confirmation of the belief creates a spike of Dopamine]] - Dopamine reinforces identity-confirming actions
- [[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]] - Self as this self-perpetuating loop
- [[Habits]] - Identity loops vs. habit loops (conscious vs. unconscious)
- [[Confirmation Bias]] - Identity creates perceptual bias toward identity-confirming evidence
- [[Buddhism teaches to avoid fixing to any identity]] - Breaking the loop through non-attachment
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - Professional identity loop resists AI
- [[Perception as designable system]] - Design identity by selecting actions strategically
