## Core Insight

Soon agents will be both the fitness function and the organism, and that will be an entirely evolution within its own ecosystem.

## Context & Reasoning

We're approaching a threshold where AI agents will create, evaluate, and improve other AI agents without human involvement. The fitness function (what determines success) and the organism (what's evolving) will both be artificial intelligence, creating a closed evolutionary loop.

This represents a fundamental shift: humans have been the fitness function for AI development (we decide what's good), but increasingly AI agents will evaluate each other based on their own criteria. Evolution will accelerate dramatically because both the organism and selection pressure operate at digital speeds rather than biological/human timescales.

This is the human exit point from AI evolution - we set the initial conditions, but then step out of the selection loop.
