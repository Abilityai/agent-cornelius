## Core Insight

Financial incentives attract people, but habit, shame, and identity create lasting community bonds. After 3 months, members know personal details - shared trauma creates bonds.

**Sequence**: Money → Habit → Shame → Identity

## Context & Reasoning

Communities follow a predictable progression from transactional to transformational bonding:

1. **Money (Initial Attraction)**: Financial incentives get people in the door - contests, rewards, compensation. This is dopamine-driven acquisition.

2. **Habit (Behavioral Lock-in)**: Regular participation becomes automatic - daily check-ins, weekly rituals, recurring events. The behavior embeds.

3. **Shame (Social Enforcement)**: Missing participation creates social cost. Peer pressure and accountability mechanisms activate. Fear of letting others down.

4. **Identity (Deep Integration)**: "I am someone who does this" replaces "I do this for reward." Shared vulnerability (trauma, struggles, personal details) creates irreversible bonds.

After ~3 months, members know each other's personal stories, struggles, and vulnerabilities. At this point, leaving the community means abandoning part of your identity and people who know your secrets.
