## Insight

Psychological safety is not about creating comfort—it's about enabling speed. When people feel safe, they move faster, fail faster, and iterate quickly because they don't waste cognitive energy on office politics, second-guessing, or fear of punishment. Safety reduces cognitive overhead, freeing mental resources for execution velocity.

## Context

This challenges the common misunderstanding that psychological safety means "being nice" or "comfortable." Instead, Eugene frames it as an execution multiplier: "Psychological safety = Faster, clearer communication."

The framework suggests:
- Safety reduces mental burden → frees cognitive resources
- Truth & transparency → speeds up decision cycles
- Experimentation without fear → rapid iteration
- "Mistakes aren't the enemy… stagnation is"

This connects directly to the Ability AI core values where psychological safety is explicitly linked to team velocity, not team comfort.

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

This integrates with:
- **Cognitive load theory** - reducing extraneous load enables faster processing
- **[[Flow is impossible without Autonomy]]** - psychological safety creates the autonomy prerequisite for flow by removing fear-based constraints
- **[[Flow is a selfless state]]** - safety reduces self-protective thinking, enabling the selfless focus required for flow
- **Decision velocity** - clear communication reduces decision friction
- **Default Mode Network** - fear/anxiety activates DMN, reducing focus

Contrasts with conventional "psychological safety = nice workplace" interpretation.
