# Relevance requires goals - selection without purpose is impossible

**Type**: Personal Theory / Cognitive Architecture / AI Insight
**Source**: Personal reflections (circa 2023)
**Uniqueness**: Identifies goal-directedness as prerequisite for determining relevance - without goals, nothing is more relevant than anything else

**Core Insight** (in author's voice):

In human brain information is memorized more when this information is relevant to the goal of a person at this moment. Selection of relevancy without a goal is impossible.

---

**Context & Reasoning**:

This is a **fundamental principle about information filtering**: Relevance is not objective - it's always relative to a goal. Without goals, you cannot determine what matters.

**The Core Principle**:

**Relevance = Goal-Relative Property**
- Information is NOT inherently relevant or irrelevant
- Relevance is determined by: "Does this help achieve my goal?"
- Without goal → No basis for determining relevance
- All information equally irrelevant (or equally relevant)

**Evidence from Memory**:

"Information is memorized more when this information is relevant to the goal of a person at this moment"

**Memory is goal-directed**:
- Brain doesn't record everything
- Encodes what's relevant to current goals
- Goal-relevant info = Stronger encoding
- Goal-irrelevant info = Weak/no encoding

**Example**:
- Reading a book on meditation while stressed → High retention (goal: reduce stress)
- Reading same book when content → Low retention (no active goal)
- Same information, different goal context → Different memorization

**The Impossibility Claim**:

"Selection of relevancy without a goal is impossible"

**Why impossible?**
- Relevance = "Matters for X"
- Without X (goal), cannot determine what matters
- Like asking "what direction is forward?" without destination
- Direction requires target
- Relevance requires goal

**Implications**:

**For AI Design**:
This has HUGE implications for AI systems:

**Problem**: How does AI determine what's relevant?
- Current LLMs: No persistent goals → No relevance filter
- They "know" everything equally
- Cannot prioritize based on goal-relevance

**Solution**: AI needs goals to have relevance
- Goal-driven agents can filter by relevance
- Memory systems need goal context
- Attention needs goal direction

**For Learning**:
- Learning requires goals (implicit or explicit)
- Without goal, nothing stands out as worth learning
- "Learn everything" is impossible (infinite information)
- "Learn what's relevant to X" is tractable

**For Attention**:
- Attention is relevance-filtering mechanism
- What you attend to = What's relevant to current goal
- ADHD might be: Weak goal activation → Weak relevance filtering
- Focus requires clear goal

**For Decision-Making**:
- Decisions require determining what's relevant
- "Should I do X?" → "Is X relevant to my goals?"
- Without goals, cannot make decisions
- Paralysis = Goal ambiguity/conflict

**Connection to AI Insight**:

This is setting up the NEXT insight about LLM perspectives:
- LLMs lack persistent goals
- Therefore, cannot have relevance filters
- Therefore, "know" everything equally
- Therefore, cannot have unique perspectives (next insight explains why)

**The Deep Question**:

**Do humans always have goals?**
- Or can we perceive without goal-direction?
- [[Focus vs Control - the matrix dichotomy of consciousness modes]]
- Focus mode = No goals, direct perception
- Control mode = Goal-driven, relevance-filtered perception

**Maybe**:
- Goal-less perception is possible (meditation, flow)
- But goal-less SELECTION is impossible
- Perception without selection vs. selection without goals
- Different things

**For AI Consciousness**:
If consciousness requires:
- [[Mind is organized around expectation-checking - predictions drive proactive behavior]]
- And expectations require goals (to determine relevance)
- Then consciousness requires goals?

---

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Mind is organized around expectation-checking - predictions drive proactive behavior]]
- [[Unique perspectives require forgetting - LLMs are average because they know everything]]
- [[Focus vs Control - the matrix dichotomy of consciousness modes]]
- Related to attention mechanisms in AI
- Related to goal-directed behavior
- Related to memory encoding and retrieval
