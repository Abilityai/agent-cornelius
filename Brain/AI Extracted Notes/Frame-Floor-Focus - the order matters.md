The scaling framework requires sequential execution: Frame (impossible goal) → Floor (eliminate below standard) → Focus (concentrate on exponential levers). Most people want to jump from Frame to Focus ("here's the goal, how do I get there?"), skipping Floor. But simplicity is a higher order concept than complexity, and subtraction is a higher order concept than addition. You must eliminate before you can properly focus.

## Why This Matters

This explains why most scaling attempts fail: entrepreneurs set ambitious goals (Frame) then immediately start building systems to achieve them (Focus), maintaining all current complexity. The missing middle step - Floor (elimination) - is psychologically hardest because it requires identity death. Saying no to good opportunities, firing B-players, abandoning working systems that don't serve 10x goals. Without Floor, Focus becomes optimizing complexity rather than pursuing simplicity.

## Connections

- [[Identity-first transformation - upgrade identity before systems]] - Floor = identity transformation checkpoint
- [[Scaling requires subtraction not addition]] - Floor operationalizes subtraction
- [[10x is easier than 2x because it forces elimination]] - Frame sets 10x target; Floor executes elimination
- [[The Floor - dividing line between good and great]] - Floor is the mechanism that converts ambition into action
- [[Identity is a set of beliefs about the world]] - Floor stage forces belief system upgrade between Frame and Focus

## Why People Skip Floor

Floor requires accepting loss: loss of past success, loss of comfortable identity, loss of good opportunities. Frame feels inspiring. Focus feels productive. Floor feels like destruction. But destruction is prerequisite for transformation - you can't build 10x business on 2x foundation.

## Example Sequence

1. Frame: "We'll reach $20M in 3 years" (from $2M)
2. Floor: "We eliminate all clients under $50K ARR and all services under 40% margin" (raises standard)
3. Focus: "We build enterprise sales system and partner network for high-value clients" (concentrates energy)

Skipping Floor: "We'll reach $20M... so let's add enterprise sales while keeping all current clients and services" (maintains complexity, ensures failure).
