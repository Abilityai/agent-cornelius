# Mind equals intentionality - consciousness is perceived when mechanics are unexplainable

**Type**: Personal Theory / Philosophy of Mind
**Source**: Personal reflections (circa 2023)
**Uniqueness**: Proposes radical theory that consciousness attribution is inversely related to explainability - we perceive others as conscious BECAUSE we can't explain their decisions

**Core Insight** (in author's voice):

What if mind=intentionality? Meaning we perceive people as conscious because the mind is unpredictable, incalculable for us. The more we know about how brain works, what causes certain things - the more there's a talk that we don't have free will. All of that means that we perceive people around as conscious because we can't explain how they make decisions. And we ascribe them free will and intentionality.

**Context & Reasoning**:

This is a **radical proposal about consciousness attribution**: We don't perceive consciousness directly - we infer it from unpredictability. When something becomes explainable, we stop attributing consciousness to it.

**The Theory**:

**Core Equation**:
```
Unpredictable/Unexplainable → Perceived as Intentional → Attributed Consciousness
Predictable/Explainable → Perceived as Mechanical → No Consciousness Attribution
```

**Evidence from Free Will Debates**:
- As neuroscience explains brain mechanisms, free will debates intensify
- The MORE we understand the brain, the LESS we believe in free will
- Pattern: Explanation → Loss of intentionality attribution → Loss of consciousness/free will

**The Mechanism**:

**Why Unexplainability = Consciousness**:
1. We can't predict/calculate another person's decisions
2. This unpredictability needs explanation
3. We assign "free will" and "consciousness" as explanatory placeholders
4. Just like [[God fills the gaps of unexplainability - intentionality assigned to chaos|God fills gaps for external unexplained events]]

**Why Explainability = No Consciousness**:
1. If we could fully predict/calculate decisions (complete brain scan + algorithm)
2. Decisions would appear mechanistic, deterministic
3. No need for "consciousness" or "free will" as explanation
4. Person appears as sophisticated machine

**Implications**:

**For AI Consciousness Debates**:
- Is AI conscious? We ask this BECAUSE AI behavior is currently unpredictable
- As we understand AI better (explain its mechanisms), we stop attributing consciousness
- But as AI becomes MORE complex/unpredictable, we attribute MORE consciousness

**For Human Consciousness**:
- Do we actually HAVE consciousness/free will?
- Or do we just ATTRIBUTE it to ourselves because we can't predict our own decisions?
- Is consciousness a cognitive illusion caused by lack of self-transparency?

**The Paradox**:
- Consciousness attribution requires unpredictability
- Understanding requires explanation
- Therefore: **Complete understanding of mind would eliminate consciousness attribution**
- Consciousness exists in the "explanation gap"

**Connection to Buddhist View**:
- [[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]] (likely in vault)
- If consciousness = Intentionality attribution due to unpredictability
- Then consciousness IS an illusion (explanatory construct, not actual entity)

**The Disturbing Question**:
If this is true, then consciousness is not a property of systems - it's a property of OBSERVERS who can't explain those systems. Consciousness would be **epistemic** (about knowledge limitations) not **ontic** (about reality).
