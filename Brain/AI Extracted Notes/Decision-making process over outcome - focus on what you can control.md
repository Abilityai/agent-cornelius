## Insight

As a founder, you never have perfect information for clear-cut decisions. You can never judge the quality of a decision before its outcome, and uncertainty never ends—it expands over time. The solution: focus on the process of decision-making, not the result. A good process gives you statistically better outcomes over time. Stack the odds in your favor, don't chase perfection.

## Framework: Roadmap for Decisions Under Uncertainty

1. **Follow a Strong Process**
   - Focus on process, not results
   - Good process → statistically better outcomes over time
   - Stack odds, don't chase perfection

2. **Balance Speed with Quality**
   - Overthinking is lethal in startups
   - Aim for 80% certainty and speed (not 99% certainty)
   - Quick "good enough" decisions keep momentum

3. **Understand Critical Mass Principle**
   - Growth feels flat (or regresses) until tipping point
   - Critical mass of: effort, output, or progress
   - Most people give up before breakthrough
   - "They mistake the plateau for failure"

**Summary:**
- Trust your gut and process
- Prioritize speed over perfection
- Push through the plateau
- "You're probably closer than you realize"

## Context

This helped Eugene "scale and exit 2 companies." The insight synthesizes process focus (from decision science) with speed bias (from startups) and persistence (critical mass).

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

Integrates with:
- **Process vs. Outcome** - Annie Duke's "Thinking in Bets"
- **Resulting fallacy** - judging decisions by outcomes, not quality
- **80/20 rule** - 80% certainty is good enough
- **S-curve adoption** - critical mass before exponential growth
- **Survivorship bias** - those who quit before critical mass aren't visible
- **Speed beats perfection** (other Eugene insight) - execution velocity

## Apparent Paradox

How to reconcile:
- **This insight:** Strong process focus
- **"Speed beats perfection":** Decision velocity over quality

Resolution: Process focus ≠ slow process. Good process at 80% certainty executed quickly.
