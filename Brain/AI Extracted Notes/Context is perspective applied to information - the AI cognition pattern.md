## Insight

"One of the interesting ways to think about agents and working with agents is to look at it in a pattern where you are applying perspective to some information. This is basically the same way as the human brain works as well. A lot of what we do, a lot of the cognition that we do is around looking at things from different perspectives and then incorporating that into our knowledge and understanding."

AI agent work fundamentally operates through **perspective engineering**: taking data (context) and applying a viewpoint/angle (perspective) to extract meaning. This mirrors human cognition where we constantly shift reference frames to analyze information.

## Context & Framework

Eugene identifies a two-component pattern in AI agent cognition:
1. **Context** = Information/data to be analyzed
2. **Perspective** = The angle/lens the agent applies to that data

This creates a formula: **Data + Perspective = Insight**

"A lot of the context engineering is about exactly that - finding some data that you need to analyze and giving it to an LLM, and then with an additional prompt or text prompt or file prompt formulating exactly how you want the agent to look at this data and what to get out of that."

**Key constraint**: Output quality is limited by BOTH inputs:
- Information completeness ("as full as possible")
- Perspective precision ("the more details you request and the more nuance you request the perspective")

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

This directly integrates with Eugene's existing frameworks:

- **[[Reference Frames]]** - Human cognition operates through reference frames; AI agents operate through applied perspectives (same mechanism)
- **[[Mind → Reference Frames → Beliefs → Identity]]** - The fundamental cognitive architecture
- **[[Judgment is picking position in reference frame]]** - AI judgment works identically
- **[[Context engineering replaces prompt engineering]]** - This provides the theoretical foundation for why context engineering matters

**Buddhist connection**:
- **[[Conceptualization of experience creates Illusion of Self]]** - Perspective is conceptualization applied to data
- Different perspectives = different conceptual filters on reality

**Neuroscience connection**:
- Default Mode Network applies perspectives to memories
- PFC selects which reference frame to use for analysis

## Uniqueness

**What makes this distinctive:**
- Explicitly connects AI agent architecture to human cognitive architecture through reference frames
- Provides a theoretical model (Data + Perspective = Output) that explains why context engineering works
- Identifies the dual-constraint problem: both information AND perspective must be precise
- Bridges Eugene's Buddhism-neuroscience framework to AI systems
