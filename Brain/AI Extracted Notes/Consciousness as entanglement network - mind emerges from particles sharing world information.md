**Core Insight**:

The mind and consciousness is created by a large number of particles sharing information about the world - entangled with the particles in the world. Our perception organs create this entanglement between world particles and our internal representation. The network of entanglement is what creates consciousness.

**Context & Reasoning**:

**Proposed Mechanism:**

1. **Perception as Entanglement Creation:**
   - Perception organs (eyes, ears, etc.) interact with world
   - This interaction creates quantum entanglement between:
     - External particles (photons, air molecules, etc.)
     - Internal particles (neurons, molecules in sensory organs)

2. **Electrical Signals as "Entanglement Transport":**
   - Brain's electrical signals might "transport" entanglement information
   - Not just classical information transfer
   - Entanglement relationships propagated through neural network

3. **Consciousness as Network Property:**
   - Individual entanglements = basic information
   - Network of many entanglements = consciousness
   - Emergent property of system, not individual particles

**Example: Vision:**
"When we see something we collaborate with photons that collaborated with other particles when they reflected from them, and particles in our eyes entangle with photons, which carry property information from the objects they reflected from."

This creates a **chain of collaboration:**
Object particles ↔ Photons ↔ Eye particles ↔ Brain particles ↔ Consciousness

**Theoretical Implications**:

1. **Consciousness isn't localized:** It's a network property distributed across entangled systems
2. **Perception isn't passive:** It's active creation of quantum relationships
3. **Mind-world boundary dissolves:** If consciousness is entanglement network, "internal" and "external" are arbitrary divisions
4. **Gradations of consciousness:** More complex entanglement networks = more sophisticated consciousness

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Self is a feeling that is created by consciousness, by thoughts]] - What if self is feeling of being part of entanglement network?
- [[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]] - Entanglement networks have no center/separate self
- [[Quantum entanglement mirrors Buddhist emptiness - properties exist only in relation]] - Consciousness as relational, not intrinsic
- [[Flow is a selfless state]] - Flow as state where entanglement network operates without self-referential looping?
- [[MOC - Buddhism and Consciousness]] - Potential quantum-Buddhist synthesis

**Critical Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**
- Provides mechanism for consciousness emergence
- Explains mind-world connection
- Compatible with Buddhist non-self

**Weaknesses:**
- Quantum decoherence in warm, wet brain (major objection to quantum consciousness theories)
- No empirical evidence for quantum coherence in neural processes
- Scale problem: particle entanglement → macro consciousness emergence unclear
- Speculative: no testable predictions yet

**Status:** Highly speculative theoretical framework. Interesting synthesis but requires significant development and faces major physics objections (decoherence problem).
