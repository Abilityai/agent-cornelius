## Core Insight

AI agents as "dictators" with constitutional constraints - enforce rules without human bias, community can modify constitution democratically.

## Context & Reasoning

The paradox of human governance: we need consistent rule enforcement but humans are biased, emotional, and politically influenced. The contrarian solution: AI agents as "benevolent dictators" that enforce community constitutions without favoritism.

**How it works:**
1. Community creates constitutional rules democratically
2. AI agents enforce rules mechanically, without bias or emotion
3. Community can modify constitution through democratic process
4. AI executes whatever constitution exists, perfectly and consistently

This separates:
- **Rule Creation** (democratic, human) from **Rule Enforcement** (dictatorial, AI)
- **What we want** (flexible, evolving) from **How it's enforced** (rigid, impartial)

The AI isn't making value judgments - it's executing codified values without the inconsistency, favoritism, or corruption that plague human enforcement.
