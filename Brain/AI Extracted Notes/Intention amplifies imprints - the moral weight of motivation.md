**Core Insight**:

Intention is the strongest factor that amplifies the imprint. Same action with different intention creates vastly different future perceptual patterns.

---

**Context & Reasoning**:

In the imprints model, **not all actions create equal imprints** - intention serves as an **amplification multiplier**:

**The mechanism**:
- Action without intention = weak imprint (habit)
- Action with strong intention = powerful imprint (transformation)
- Intention = cognitive/emotional investment in the action

**Examples**:
- Helping someone **to get praise** vs. **from genuine compassion** - same behavior, different imprints
- Helping reluctantly vs. wholeheartedly - different future perception patterns
- Speaking truth to **harm** vs. speaking truth to **benefit** - same words, different karmic weight

**Why intention matters**:
1. **Attention allocation** - intention focuses cognitive resources, strengthening neural encoding
2. **Emotional charge** - intention adds emotional weight, enhancing memory consolidation
3. **Coherence** - intention aligns action with deeper values, creating stronger patterns
4. **Dopamine modulation** - intention affects reward prediction, shaping future motivation

This parallels:
- **Encoding specificity** (psychology) - intention improves memory encoding
- **Deliberate practice** (learning) - intentional action creates faster skill development
- **Moral philosophy** - intent distinguishes accident from murder
- **Goal-setting** - intention focuses effort and attention

**Buddhist list of powerful intentions** (from source):
- Not being angry and aggressive
- Gratitude
- Love and compassion to all living beings
- Helping people selflessly
- Seeing others as yourself
- Truthfulness (no lies)
- Lack of empty talk (no gossip)
- Avoiding pride and jealousy
