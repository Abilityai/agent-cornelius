## Insight

"It is so much easier now, and it's getting more and more easy to create something from scratch vs. understand something that was already created. That means that the created stuff gradually will lose its value and will just be recreated from scratch in higher and higher scales. So the more genetic capabilities grow, the more stuff we will be able to recreate from scratch without the need of existing if we can describe it in enough details."

**Value inversion**: Creating from scratch is becoming easier than understanding existing systems. This means **created artifacts lose preservation value** because regeneration is cheaper than comprehension. The valuable asset is the ability to describe/specify, not the artifact itself.

## Context & Reasoning

Eugene observes a fundamental shift in value dynamics:

**Old paradigm**:
- Understanding existing code/systems is easier than creating
- Preservation makes economic sense (reverse-engineering > rebuilding)
- Existing assets have high value (hard to recreate)

**New paradigm**:
- Creating from scratch easier than comprehending existing
- Recreation makes economic sense (rebuilding > reverse-engineering)
- Existing assets lose value (easy to recreate with AI)

**Key implication**: "Feels like the mode of 'we're doing it when we need it' is going to be a prevailing strategy in company management and operations management. Because most probably going forward, it will be way easier to build what you need when you need it than try to plan ahead."

**Just-in-time everything**:
- Don't plan ahead → build when needed
- Don't preserve code → regenerate when needed
- Don't document → describe and rebuild

**Critical constraint**: "If we can describe it in enough details"
- Description quality becomes the bottleneck
- Specification ability = core value
- Articulation > preservation

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

**Value shift**:
- **[[Intellectual property]]** - IP shifts from artifacts to specifications
- **[[Knowledge work]]** - From understanding existing → specifying desired
- **[[Assets]]** - Code/content become disposable, generation capability is the asset

**Comprehension difficulty**:
- **[[Code complexity]]** - Understanding spaghetti code is cognitively expensive
- **[[Legacy systems]]** - Often easier to rebuild than understand
- AI makes rebuild option viable at scale

**Economic implications**:
- **[[Sunk cost fallacy]]** - Existing code becomes sunk cost (recreation is cheaper)
- **[[Opportunity cost]]** - Cost of understanding > cost of rebuilding
- **[[Creative destruction]]** - Accelerated replacement of existing with new

**Planning implications**:
- **[[Uncertainty]]** - Future needs uncertain → defer building until needed
- **[[Optionality]]** - Keep options open by not committing to specific implementations
- **[[Flexibility]]** - Regeneration capability provides ultimate flexibility

## Connection to Other Insights

**Integrates with**:
- **[[AI failure reflects human articulation failure]]** - Articulation quality determines recreation success
- **[[Context is perspective applied to information]]** - Description = perspective on desired outcome
- **[[Intellectual chains]]** - Regenerate entire chains rather than preserve outputs

## Uniqueness

**What makes this contrarian:**
- Challenges preservation culture (documentation, maintenance, legacy systems)
- Inverts traditional value proposition (existing > new becomes new > existing)
- Questions planning and preparation ("do it when you need it")
- Suggests technical debt may be irrelevant (just rebuild)

**Radical implication**: Code bases, documentation, and preserved systems become **negative value** if recreation is cheaper than comprehension.

**Critical skill shift**:
- From: Understanding complex systems
- To: Specifying desired systems clearly
- The skill is articulation, not comprehension

**Business model implications**:
- SaaS with locked-in data loses value (can rebuild the app)
- Code repositories less valuable (can regenerate)
- Specifications, prompts, and requirements gain value
