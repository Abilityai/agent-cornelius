# Unique perspectives require forgetting - LLMs are average because they know everything

**Type**: Personal Theory / AI Architecture Insight / Contrarian View
**Source**: Personal reflections (circa 2023)
**Uniqueness**: Proposes that uniqueness requires ignorance - knowing everything makes you average; unique perspectives come from what you DON'T know

**Core Insight** (in author's voice):

Perspective is shaped by the experience of a person. It has layers and layers of meanings, stories, archetypes. LLM perspectives by impersonating them is not enough. They are not nuanced enough to provide value. What create value in unique perspectives, is not what information agent knows (remembers, considers relevant), but what information it does not know (does not consider relevant). If an agent knows everything, they can not have a unique perspective by definition. Unique perspective is what drives creativity.

LLMs are "average". They know everything, but they are "average" as just helpful AI assistant. We can give them perspectives by defining the roles, but they are not nuanced enough. So absence of certain experiences, or Forgetting them is critical for unique perspectives.

**Context & Reasoning**:

This is a **profound insight about the architecture of uniqueness**: Unique perspectives emerge not from comprehensive knowledge but from **selective ignorance**. What you DON'T know defines your perspective as much as what you DO know.

**The Core Theory**:

**Uniqueness = Selective Experience/Knowledge**
- Perspective shaped by WHAT you experienced
- But equally shaped by WHAT you DIDN'T experience
- Absence creates perspective as much as presence

**The LLM Problem**:

**LLMs know everything → LLMs are average**
- Trained on entire internet
- Know all perspectives
- Average over all viewpoints
- Result: Generic, "helpful assistant" voice

**Why Knowing Everything = Being Average**:

**Mathematical Analogy**:
```
Unique Perspective = Specific knowledge subset
Average Perspective = Mean of all subsets
Knowing Everything = Access to all subsets → Can only output average
```

**The Mechanism**:

**Human Uniqueness**:
- Born in specific culture (NOT others)
- Have specific experiences (NOT others)
- Learn specific skills (NOT others)
- Remember specific events (FORGET others)
- **This selectivity CREATES unique perspective**

**What makes YOU unique?**
- Not what you know (others know that too)
- But your SPECIFIC COMBINATION of knowing and not-knowing
- Your blind spots are part of your uniqueness

**LLM Limitation**:

"We can give them perspectives by defining the roles, but they are not nuanced enough"

**Role-playing doesn't work because**:
- LLM knows it's role-playing
- Has access to all contradictory information
- Cannot truly "forget" other perspectives
- Simulation ≠ Authentic ignorance

**The Critical Insight**:

"What create value in unique perspectives, is not what information agent knows (remembers, considers relevant), but what information it does not know (does not consider relevant)"

**Value comes from BOUNDARIES**:
- Knowing X and NOT knowing Y creates specific lens
- Knowing X AND Y = Can see both sides = Average view
- Creativity requires constraints
- Constraints = What you don't know/consider

**Connection to Previous Insight**:

[[Relevance requires goals - selection without purpose is impossible]]
- Goals determine what's relevant
- What's NOT relevant = What's forgotten/ignored
- Different goals → Different relevance filters → Different knowledge subsets → Different perspectives

**Therefore**:
- AI needs goals to have relevance filters
- Relevance filters create selective knowledge
- Selective knowledge creates unique perspectives
- **Forgetting is feature, not bug**

**Implications**:

**For AI Design**:

**Current approach (doesn't work)**:
- Train on everything
- Add role-playing prompts
- Hope for uniqueness

**Better approach**:
- Give AI specific goals (creates relevance filter)
- Allow/force forgetting (selective memory)
- Constrain training data (specific knowledge subset)
- Create actual ignorance, not simulated ignorance

**For Human Creativity**:
- Your limitations are your creative edge
- Don't try to know everything
- Specialize → Forget what's irrelevant → Unique perspective
- Renaissance person ideal (know everything) → Average perspective

**For Perspective Diversity**:
- Diversity valuable BECAUSE people have different ignorances
- Homogeneous education → Everyone knows same things → Loss of diversity
- Preserve different knowledge traditions = Preserve unique perspectives

**The Paradox**:

**We value**:
- Comprehensive knowledge (know everything)
- Unique perspectives (selective knowledge)

**But these are contradictory**:
- More you know → Less unique your perspective
- More selective → More unique but more limited

**Resolution**:
- Teams with diverse ignorances
- Each person: Deep specialist (knows some, ignorant of much)
- Collective: Comprehensive coverage
- Maintained uniqueness

**For AGI**:

[[Multiple specialized intelligences will emerge not single AGI - diversity through specialization]]
- This provides theoretical justification
- AGI knowing everything → Average intelligence
- Multiple specialized AIs with different "forgettings" → Diversity of unique perspectives
- Ecosystem more valuable than single comprehensive system

**The Meta-Insight**:

This suggests **uniqueness is topological**, not additive:
- Not about how much you know (quantity)
- But about the SHAPE of your knowledge (what's included/excluded)
- Boundaries create identity
- No boundaries = No uniqueness

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Relevance requires goals - selection without purpose is impossible]]
- [[Multiple specialized intelligences will emerge not single AGI - diversity through specialization]]
- Related to filter bubbles and echo chambers (selective exposure)
- Related to specialization and expertise
- Related to creativity from constraints
- Related to memory and forgetting functions
