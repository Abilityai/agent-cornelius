**Core Insight** (in Eugene's voice):

"From customer support to cybersecurity, AI agents are making a substantial impact across industries. Mostly those Agents are horizontal - i.e. working across industries. Vertical agent solutions are less common these days."

**Context & Reasoning**:

Eugene observes a clear market pattern in the AI agent landscape (August 2024):

**Market Reality**:
- Investment skyrocketed: $250M (2022) → nearly $1B (2024 YTD)
- Most successful agents are horizontal (cross-industry)
- Vertical (domain-specific) agents are "less common"

**Structural Reason** (implied):
Horizontal solutions require:
- General AI/ML expertise (increasingly available)
- Common workflows (similar across industries)
- Broad market applicability (faster GTM)

Vertical solutions require:
- Domain expertise (scarce, expensive)
- Industry-specific knowledge (hard to acquire)
- Deep understanding of specialized workflows
- Regulatory/compliance knowledge in many cases

**Market Implication**:
Early-stage market favors horizontal because:
- Easier to build (don't need rare domain expertise)
- Faster to market (generalized problems)
- Larger addressable market (all industries)
- VC-friendly (bigger TAM)

Vertical will eventually dominate because:
- Higher value capture (domain-specific value)
- Stronger moats (expertise barriers)
- Better unit economics (specialized solutions command premium)
- But requires scarce talent combination: AI expertise + deep domain knowledge

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Technology adoption curve]] - Why general solutions emerge first
- [[Domain expertise as moat]] - Competitive advantage of vertical solutions
- [[Market timing]] - When to build horizontal vs vertical
- [[Talent scarcity]] - Constraint on vertical solution development
- [[Product-market fit]] - Easier to find with horizontal initially
