## Insight

High-agency people don't wait for permission or perfect conditions—they move, create opportunities where others see obstacles, and figure out HOW instead of asking "Can this be done?" It's a bias toward action that's never been more important as the world shifts faster than ever. In the AI context, the best operators aren't "using" AI but "guiding" it, because AI itself is high agency—it doesn't wait, it generates, builds, and adapts.

## Context

Eugene tracks the evolution of terminology:
- Used to be "grit"
- Then "disruptor"
- Now Silicon Valley's favorite: "high agency"

**Observable trend:**
- Employers screening for it
- 500% increase in social media mentions
- Investors hunting for founders who embody it

**Core behaviors:**
- Don't wait for permission
- Don't sit around hoping for perfect conditions
- Create opportunities where others see obstacles
- Build, experiment, push forward autonomously

**Key examples:**
- Founders who bootstrap without funding
- People who pivot, adapt, and break through every limitation

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

Integrates with:
- **Radical Ownership** - both emphasize autonomy and outcome ownership
- **Locus of Control** (psychology) - internal vs. external control beliefs
- **Agency theory** - principal-agent problems, but flipped (high agency agents need less oversight)
- **Entrepreneurial mindset** - treating uncertainty as playground, not obstacle
- **Mission Command** - operate on intent, not detailed orders

## AI Dimension

Eugene adds unique angle: "AI itself is high agency. It doesn't wait. It generates, it builds, it adapts."

This creates a complementarity:
- **High-agency humans** + **High-agency AI** = exponential capability
- **Low-agency humans** + **High-agency AI** = humans become bottleneck

The world needs "more people who don't wait… The ones who continue to build and iterate."

## Diagnostic Question

"Are you operating with high agency?"

Self-assessment framework:
- Do you wait for permission or move forward?
- Do you see obstacles or opportunities?
- Do you ask "Can this be done?" or figure out "How to do it?"
