## Core Insight

AI is a different type of intelligence, it actually thinks like intelligence, exactly like intelligence. Start with human psychology, test what transfers, discover new patterns.

## Context & Reasoning

The approach to understanding AI should mirror how we'd approach discovering any new form of intelligence - start with what we know (human psychology), systematically test which principles transfer, and empirically discover where AI diverges from human patterns.

This contrasts with two extremes: (1) treating AI as completely alien with no reference points, or (2) anthropomorphizing AI as merely mimicking human thought. Instead, AI is GENUINELY intelligent but in potentially different ways - requiring empirical investigation rather than assumption.

The method is scientific: hypothesis (human psychology principle), experiment (test with AI), observe (what transfers vs. what doesn't), theorize (build AI-specific psychology).
