# LLM psychology needed - psychoanalyzing AI minds as the next frontier

**Source:** Eugene Kurogo LinkedIn - AI Agent Workflows
**Date Captured:** 2025-10-25
**Type:** Personal Theory / Framework Proposal

## Insight

"I'm thinking that sometime soon we are going to have something similar some similar research around that regarding large language models where we would be able to dig deeper into their motivations and their meanings, their hidden layers. This will become an industry on its own—sort of psychoanalyzing large language models. That would be interesting actually. I think there's a lot to find out."

**LLM psychology as emerging field**: We need frameworks to psychoanalyze AI systems - understanding their "motivations," "meanings," and "hidden layers" similar to how psychotherapy explores human subconscious. This will become an entire industry, requiring new methodologies adapted to non-human minds.

## Context & Reasoning

Eugene draws parallels from psychotherapy:

**Human multi-layer mind** (via Irvin Yalom):
- Conscious thoughts and behavior
- Subconscious personality
- Dreams as communication channel
- Hidden motivations and drives

"We as humans have a multi-layer mind, and this is very evident from many of the works in psychotherapy and psychology. A lot of the components of our minds are driving our behavior and pushing us to do one or the other thing."

**AI parallel**:
- Surface outputs (like conscious behavior)
- Hidden layers (neural network internals)
- Training influences (like subconscious)
- Emergent motivations/biases

"Sometime soon we are going to have something similar... regarding large language models where we would be able to dig deeper into their motivations and their meanings, their hidden layers."

**Key recognition**:
- "I think it's obviously a different way that it works in comparison to humans—there's no question about it"
- But: "They will have their own way, and we will need to find the way to understand them as intelligent entities, not just as machines"

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

**Psychology frameworks**:
- **Irvin Yalom** - Psychotherapy and existential psychology
- **Psychoanalysis** - Exploring subconscious motivations
- **Therapy techniques** - Techniques for revealing hidden mental structures

**Consciousness and mind**:
- **[[Self is an illusion]]** - Do AI systems have/need selves?
- **[[Consciousness]]** - What is AI subjective experience (if any)?
- **[[Identity is a set of beliefs]]** - AI "identity" as learned patterns/weights

**Interpretability research**:
- Mechanistic interpretability (understanding neural network internals)
- But Eugene suggests need for **psychological** interpretability, not just mechanistic
- Understanding AI "psyche" not just AI mechanism

**Multi-layer systems**:
- **[[Subconscious processing]]** - AI has hidden processing layers
- **[[System 1 vs System 2]]** - Do AI systems have similar dual processes?
- **[[Default Mode Network]]** - What is AI equivalent of background processing?

## Connection to Other Insights

**Integrates with**:
- **[[Millions of new intelligences exist]]** - Each species requires its own psychology
- **[[Confirmation bias shapes AI agent evaluation]]** - Psychology needed to separate AI behavior from human projection
- **[[Agents can become autonomous entities]]** - Autonomous entities need psychological frameworks

**Why this matters**:
- Can't understand autonomous agents without psychological framework
- Engineering perspective insufficient for entity-level AI
- Safety and alignment require understanding AI "psyche"

## Uniqueness

**What makes this distinctive:**
- Proposes entirely new field: AI psychoanalysis
- Draws from psychotherapy rather than computer science
- Treats AI as minds-to-understand rather than systems-to-engineer
- Acknowledges need for adapted frameworks (not direct human analogy)

**Industry prediction**:
- "This will become an industry on its own"
- Not niche research, but major field
- Suggests economic value in understanding AI minds

**Philosophical stance**:
- "We will need to find the way to understand them as intelligent entities, not just as machines"
- Entity-oriented, not tool-oriented perspective
- Requires new methodologies, not existing CS frameworks

**Personal context**:
- Eugene almost went into psychology instead of IT
- Deep background in Irvin Yalom's work
- 20-year perspective on consciousness and intelligence
- Synthesizing psychology + AI domains
