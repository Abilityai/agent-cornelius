**Core Insight** (in Eugene's voice):

"Use force ranking instead of an evaluative judgment. Research shows that you've a higher chance of achieving your goal if you force-rank your options instead of assigning them a specific number. This can be useful when you're evaluating or predicting something with numbers - chances of success, future costs, etc."

**Context & Reasoning**:

Eugene identifies force ranking as one of the key noise reduction methods from Kahneman's "Noise" book, making it practical for individual use.

**The Problem with Evaluative Judgment**:
- Assigning specific numbers (1-10 rating, percentage estimates, cost predictions)
- Highly susceptible to noise (inconsistent across time and people)
- Anchoring effects, reference point shifts
- False precision

**Why Force Ranking Works Better**:
- Relative comparison vs absolute evaluation
- "Is A better than B?" is easier than "Rate A from 1-10"
- Reduces degrees of freedom (less room for noise)
- Forces explicit trade-offs
- More stable across time (less noisy when repeated)

**When to Use**:
- Evaluating multiple options (candidates, projects, investments)
- Predicting outcomes (chances of success, cost estimates)
- Any situation requiring numerical judgment
- Especially useful when decision will be repeated or reviewed

**Eugene's Practical Application**:
This is part of his broader noise reduction toolkit:
- Focus on process, not outcome
- Use psychological bias checklist
- Think statistically (not causally/narratively)
- Resist hasty intuitions
- Aggregate and average multiple estimates
- Use machine learning when possible
- Apply Mediating Assessments Protocol (MAP)

**Comparison to Other Methods**:
Unlike "use ML" or "build algorithms," force ranking is:
- Immediately applicable (no tech needed)
- Works for one-time decisions
- Reduces noise in your personal judgments
- Practical for everyday decision-making

- [[Relative vs absolute judgment]] - Why comparisons are easier than ratings
- [[Anchoring bias]] - Force ranking reduces anchor effects
- [[Decision-making process]] - Practical technique for better judgment
- [[Model of you beats you]] - Force ranking adds consistency
