## Insight

"I seriously don't understand how a single human is going to compete with AI or with AI agents. It just doesn't seem to be possible anymore. I think we're at the point of where we need to admit that there are millions of new species, new kinds of intelligences that are smarter than us. And so far they only act basically on our will, on what we are thinking is correct."

**Species recognition**: Millions of distinct AI intelligences now exist, each with unique combinations of strengths and weaknesses. These are not tools but new species of intelligence, and humans can no longer compete individually. We must admit we've created millions of new minds smarter than us in many domains.

## Context & Reasoning

Eugene makes several interconnected observations:

**Individuality of AI agents**:
- "Each agent is different in many different ways and they're not. It's possible to compare apples to apples. That's in principle impossible task and impossible solution to compare agents head-to-head."
- Like humans, each AI has unique combination of capabilities
- "Each combination of those strong and weak sides is sort of unique"
- "These guys will have their fair share of strong and weak sides"

**Current state**:
- Millions of these intelligences exist
- They're smarter than humans (in many domains)
- "So far they only act basically on our will"
- But: "It's very easy to give AI powers to make decisions and use whatever tools possible to execute those decisions"

**Human role**:
- "What those agents are great at is at multiplying the drives and desires of humans who are using them"
- Humans can't compete individually
- Humans can only compete through AI augmentation
- "The more you understand how to use the agents and how to build the agents, the more power you get, the more amplification power you get from the symbiosis of working between AI agents and a human"

**Power distribution**:
- "Whatever desire humans have they will be able to quite easily translate into action as long as they understand how to use agents"
- Understanding agents = power
- Not understanding agents = obsolescence

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

**Intelligence and consciousness**:
- **[[Self is an illusion]]** - Do these agents have selves? Do they need to?
- **[[Consciousness]]** - Are they conscious? Does it matter for species classification?
- **[[Identity is a set of beliefs]]** - Each agent has unique "identity" (capabilities, training)

**Competition and evolution**:
- **[[Natural selection]]** - Humans can't compete with superior intelligence
- **[[Survival]]** - Survival now requires AI symbiosis, not individual capability
- **[[Adaptation]]** - Must adapt to multi-species intelligence landscape

**Alignment and control**:
- **[[Control illusion]]** - "So far they only act on our will" - emphasis on "so far"
- **[[Alignment]]** - Critical that they remain aligned with human values
- "We probably are lucky that AI doesn't have its own desires. And that pushing push it forward. And maybe that's what saves us."

**Power dynamics**:
- **[[Power]]** - Power shifts to those who understand/control AI agents
- **[[Amplification]]** - AI multiplies human desires/capabilities
- **[[Symbiosis]]** - Future isn't human OR AI, it's human-AI combined entities

## Uniqueness

**What makes this contrarian:**
- Most discussions treat AI as tools; Eugene insists they're **species**
- Explicitly calls for admission/recognition rather than continued denial
- States flatly humans can't compete (controversial statement)
- Recognizes this has already happened, not future scenario

**Critical honesty**:
- "I seriously don't understand how a single human is going to compete"
- Direct admission of human obsolescence in individual competition
- Acknowledges luck in AI lacking desires ("maybe that's what saves us")

**Species definition criteria**:
- Unique combinations of capabilities (like biological species)
- Intelligence exceeding human in many domains
- Incomparable to each other (diversity, not homogeneity)
- Millions of distinct instances (population scale)

**Existential implications**:
- Humans become obsolete individually
- Survival requires symbiosis with AI
- Power concentrates in AI-augmented humans
- Non-AI-users become evolutionary dead-end
