**Core Insight** (in Eugene's voice):

"In just about any real investment system, you're dealing with a Non-Ergodic system. This means that the probability of your success doesn't work the same way as a probability based on the statistics of that investment good."

And the implication:

"If any of those bets can result in the loss of your entire stack (if you bet all or most of it) and you can't keep playing (you're in a non-ergodic system) - you won't be able to achieve the probability of success of that bet in that short time."

**Context & Reasoning**:

Eugene explains that Kelly Criterion solves a specific problem: **survival in non-ergodic systems**.

**The Non-Ergodic Problem**:
- Ensemble probability (average across many players) ≠ Time probability (single player over time)
- If you can go bust (lose everything), you exit the game permanently
- Can't rely on long-run statistics if you don't survive to the long run
- Example: Angel investing needs ~30 investments to approach industry average returns

**Kelly Criterion Solution**:
Formula: Kelly fraction = W - (1-W)/O

Where:
- W = probability of winning (0 to 1)
- O = ratio of payout to bet (expected multiplier)

**Eugene's Example**:
Early-stage startup investment:
- W = 0.02 (2% success probability)
- O = 100 (100x return if successful)
- Kelly fraction = 0.02 - (1-0.02)/100 = 0.0102 = **1.02% of portfolio**

**Why It Works**:
- Sizes bets to survive losing streaks
- Maximizes expected value of portfolio over time
- "Pretty much guarantees you won't go broke"
- Prevents single bet from causing ruin

**Critical Limitation Eugene Notes**:
"The Kelly criterion is only valid when the probabilities of outcomes are known, which isn't always the case with investments. While it can be a helpful tool, it's not a guarantee of success."
