# Multiple specialized intelligences will emerge not single AGI - diversity through specialization

**Type**: Contrarian View / AI Future Prediction
**Source**: Personal reflections (circa 2023)
**Uniqueness**: Challenges AGI narrative - predicts ecosystem of specialized intelligences rather than single general AI

**Core Insight** (in author's voice):

There will be more than one kind of intelligence, not just the AGI. They will be specialized in different things. All I'm doing now is running an experiment, a research, to find and build a kind of intelligence that will stand out.

---

**Context & Reasoning**:

This is a **contrarian prediction** about AI future that challenges the dominant "race to AGI" narrative. Instead of one general intelligence, the author predicts an **ecosystem of specialized intelligences**.

**The Prediction**:

**NOT: Single AGI**
- One artificial general intelligence
- Universal problem-solver
- Replaces/surpasses humans across all domains

**INSTEAD: Multiple Specialized Intelligences**
- Many different AI architectures
- Each specialized for specific domains
- Diversity through specialization
- Parallel evolution, not singular convergence

**Why This Makes Sense**:

**Biological Precedent**:
- Evolution didn't create "general animals"
- Created specialists: Eagles (vision), dolphins (echolocation), humans (abstract reasoning)
- Specialization is evolutionarily stable strategy
- Generalization is expensive

**Economic Precedent**:
- Markets create specialists, not generalists
- Most successful companies focus on specific niches
- "Jack of all trades, master of none"
- Specialization allows excellence

**Computational Precedent**:
- Current AI landscape already shows this pattern
- AlphaFold (protein folding), GPT (language), DALL-E (images)
- Each excels in specific domain
- No single system dominates everything

**The Strategy**:

"All I'm doing now is running an experiment, a research, to find and build a kind of intelligence that will stand out"

**This reveals**:
- Author is working on AI research/development
- Goal: Not compete for AGI
- Goal: Find unique specialization
- Strategy: Differentiation, not generalization

**Implications**:

**For AI Development**:
- Don't try to build AGI
- Find specific domain where you can excel
- Deep specialization > Broad generalization
- Success = Standing out in niche, not matching AGI

**For AI Safety**:
- Multiple specialized AIs might be safer than single AGI
- Diverse ecosystem has checks and balances
- Single superintelligence = Single point of failure
- Specialization limits scope of potential harm

**For AI Economics**:
- Market will reward specialists
- Companies building focused AI tools will succeed
- "AGI or nothing" is wrong framing
- Value in specialized excellence

**For Human-AI Collaboration**:
- Humans remain generalists
- AI provides specialized super-capabilities
- Human + Specialized AI > Human alone
- Collaborative intelligence model

**The Question**:

**What determines which intelligences emerge?**
- Market demand?
- Technical feasibility?
- Random exploration?
- Evolutionary competition?

**Connection to Chaos/Order Insight**:
[[Self-sustaining order emerges from chaos - survival determines persistence]]
- Many AI architectures will be tried (chaos)
- Only self-sustaining ones will persist (selection)
- We'll see diversity of survivors, not single winner
- AGI narrative assumes single convergent solution, but why?

**The Meta-Insight**:

This reflects **contrarian thinking**:
- Everyone chasing AGI
- Author sees different path
- Specialization as viable alternative
- Standing out > Fitting in

**Personal Application**:
Same principle applies to humans:
- Don't try to be good at everything (human AGI)
- Find your unique specialization
- Stand out in specific domain
- Ecosystem values diversity

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Self-sustaining order emerges from chaos - survival determines persistence]] - Multiple paths to survival
- Related to evolution and specialization
- Related to competitive strategy and positioning
- Related to AI safety and alignment
- Related to market dynamics and winner-take-all vs. ecosystem models
