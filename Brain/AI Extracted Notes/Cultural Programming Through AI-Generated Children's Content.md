## Core Insight

One way to adjust the future of humanity is to find a way to program children to certain beliefs, brands, mental structures using AI to create cartoons that will flourish when they grow up.

## Context & Reasoning

AI dramatically lowers the cost of creating children's content at scale, enabling targeted cultural programming with unprecedented precision. Instead of expensive studios producing generic content, AI can generate personalized cartoons embedding specific beliefs, values, brand associations, and mental frameworks.

The strategy is multi-generational: plant cognitive seeds in childhood that flourish decades later when that generation gains decision-making power. Children's content shapes identity formation, establishes reference frames, and creates belief structures that persist into adulthood.

This is both an observation about power (how cultural influence could work) and a warning (how it might be misused). The barrier isn't ethics or capability - it's recognizing the opportunity and having multi-decade patience.
