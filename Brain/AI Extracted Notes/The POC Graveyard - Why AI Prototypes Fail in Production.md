# The POC Graveyard - Why AI Prototypes Fail in Production

The ease of building AI prototypes creates a dangerous illusion: organizations accumulate impressive demos that never reach production. This is the "POC Graveyard" - a collection of proofs-of-concept that proved the concept but died before delivering value.

## The Prototype-to-Production Gap

"It's very easy in this world to get to the prototype stage, to get to the point when, okay, we have something working. We can take it to the boardroom and show how advanced we are. But the trick is not building a POC, the trick is taking the POC to production implementation and making sure that it runs consistently without errors and actually creates revenue."

## Why POCs Die

### 1. Engineering Complexity Underestimated
Building production-grade AI systems requires:
- **Reliability** - consistent performance under varying conditions
- **Quality assurance** - handling edge cases and hallucinations
- **Observability** - monitoring, logging, debugging
- **Backup systems** - graceful failure and recovery
- **Business process integration** - understanding workflows, not just technology

### 2. The Wrong Person for the Job
Common pattern: "Find a talented, curious engineer who has AI as a hobby. Give them the implementation. Watch it fail."

**Why this fails:**
- Building agentic systems requires understanding business processes (not just coding)
- Production AI is a complex engineering project, not a side experiment
- Hobbyist expertise ≠ production engineering expertise

### 3. Success Theater
POCs serve organizational theater ("look how advanced we are") rather than value creation. The demo becomes the goal, not the deployed system generating revenue.

## The 90% Failure Rate

"The percentage of failed implementations right now is somewhere around 90%."

This isn't because organizations lack smart people - it's because they confuse:
- **Proof of concept** with **proof of value**
- **Demo-ready** with **production-ready**
- **Hobbyist interest** with **production expertise**

## Path to Production Success

Successful implementations require:
1. **High-level expertise and resources** - not side projects
2. **Right technologies and correct approaches** - informed by daily engagement
3. **Business process understanding** - AI serves workflows, not replaces them
4. **Production engineering discipline** - observability, reliability, quality from day one

## Connections

- [[Knowledge Decay in Rapidly Evolving Fields]] - hobbyist knowledge becomes outdated quickly
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - production requires building systems, not demos
- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - POCs provide false confidence
- [[Professional identity creates AI resistance]] - admitting POC ≠ production threatens competence

## Questions Raised

- What percentage of enterprise AI budgets are trapped in POC graveyards?
- How do you distinguish "technology not ready" from "we didn't build it right"?
- At what point does POC success become an organizational liability (false confidence)?
- What governance structures prevent POC theater while encouraging experimentation?
