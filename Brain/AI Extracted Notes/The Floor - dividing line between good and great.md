The "floor" is the dividing line between good and great - your standard for what you refuse to accept. Raising your floor is the crux of scaling and upward mobility. It means saying "no" to what you formerly said "yes" to, and saying "no" to even what most outliers would say "yes" to. The higher the goal, the higher your floor must be.

## Why This Matters

This operationalizes the concept of standards as an elimination mechanism, not just aspiration. Walking away from your past self requires eliminating: good-but-not-great business aspects, lesser goals inherited from previous identity, relationships misaligned with bigger vision, comfortable but limiting patterns. Anything "below the floor" shouldn't exist in your business.

## Connections

- [[Finding a confirmation of belief creates dopamine spike]] - Raising the floor means accepting identity death (old standards = old self), triggering dopamine resistance
- [[Identity is a set of Beliefs]] - Your current floor reflects your current identity; scaling requires identity upgrade first
- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - A higher floor reduces uncertainty by pre-deciding what's unacceptable
- [[The 95-5 AI Divide as Identity-Dopamine Reinforcement - Why Losers Can't Copy Winners]] - Floor represents identity-based standards that winners enforce but losers can't adopt

## Example

One company moved from $2M to $20M revenue after raising their team standards - they fired B-players who would have been acceptable at $2M level, even though it felt painful. Their new floor eliminated the option of "good enough" team members.
