## Insight

The speed of your decisions matters far more than their quality. In startups, waiting for the "perfect" decision leads to analysis paralysis—by the time you decide, someone else will have moved ahead. The best way forward is to run fast experiments, learn, and adapt. Aim for momentum, not perfection.

## Context

Eugene describes his expectation when joining YayPay in 2016: "I literally assumed the success of a startup relied on making the best possible decisions. Spoiler: I was so wrong."

**Framework:**
1. Make good-enough decisions quickly (speed over perfection, then iterate)
2. Fall in love with experiments (trial-and-error is your best friend)
3. Act fast (first-mover advantage in gaining traction and raising funds)

**Core principle:** "Speed ALWAYS beats perfection"

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

Integrates with:
- **Decision-making under uncertainty** - perfect information is impossible, speed matters
- **Optionality** - fast decisions preserve options, slow decisions foreclose them
- **OODA Loop** (Boyd) - observe-orient-decide-act cycle speed as competitive advantage
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation** - fast experiments enable more exploration
- **Resulting fallacy** - judging decisions by outcomes vs. process (speed is process metric)
- **Kelly Criterion** - bet sizing matters more than bet perfection

## Apparent Tension

This creates interesting tension with:
- **Systematic decision-making** frameworks (which Eugene also values)
- **Process optimization** for judgment quality
- Question: When does speed sacrifice too much quality? Where's the threshold?

Possible resolution: Speed for **verifiable** decisions (can test quickly), slower for **non-verifiable** decisions (can't reverse easily). But even then, Eugene suggests speed wins.
