**Core Insight** (in Eugene's voice):

"And now the thing that really shocked me - the model of you beats you! Once again, the model trained on your judgments and predictions tends to do better than you on future decisions. Kahneman says, 'There is so much noise in judgment that a noise-free model of a judge achieves more accurate predictions than the actual judge does.'"

**Context & Reasoning**:

Eugene synthesizes research from Kahneman's "Noise" book, highlighting a hierarchy of findings that progressively shock:

**Level 1** (Expected): Models trained on outcomes beat humans
- Linear regression on decision outcomes + input data
- Not surprising - this is known

**Level 2** (Interesting): Equally-weighted models beat humans
- Simple average of input data (no training!)
- Performs worse than trained models but STILL beats humans in most cases

**Level 3** (Shocking): Model of YOU beats YOU
- Model trained on YOUR past judgments
- Outperforms you on future decisions
- Reason: Eliminates your inconsistency (noise)

**Level 4** (Mind-blowing): Random linear models beat humans
Eugene quotes the research:
"In one of the three samples, 77% of the ten thousand randomly weighted linear models did better than the human experts. In the other two samples, 100% of the random models outperformed the humans. Or, to put it bluntly, it proved almost impossible in that study to generate a simple model that did worse than the experts did."

**Eugene's Interpretation**:
The hierarchy reveals that **human inconsistency (noise)** is so severe that:
1. ANY consistent process beats inconsistent human judgment
2. Even random weights, applied consistently, outperform humans
3. The problem isn't that humans lack expertise - it's that humans can't apply their expertise consistently

**Implication**:
- Consistency > Expertise (when expertise is noisy)
- Simple algorithmic decision rules > Complex human judgment
- Your past self (averaged) > Your present self (single instance)

- [[Noise is an undesirable variability of judgements]] - Core problem this finding reveals
- [[Consistency vs accuracy distinction]] - Why consistent mediocrity beats inconsistent excellence
- [[Algorithm aversion]] - Why people resist this finding
- [[Decision automation]] - Practical application of this insight
- [[System 1 vs System 2]] - Why intuitive judgment is so noisy
