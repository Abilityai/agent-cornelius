## Insight

Entrepreneurs exist to DE-RISK an idea, turning a risky concept into something investors, customers, and partners will believe in. The job isn't to eliminate uncertainty but to manage it over time. If a venture is too certain, it likely won't bring big rewards—the biggest opportunities come from the riskiest ideas.

## Context

This reframes entrepreneurship from "building a business" to "transforming uncertainty into calculated risk." The key distinction is that 90% of the time entrepreneurs work under uncertainty, especially in early stages. The insight challenges the notion that uncertainty is a problem to solve—instead, it's the game itself.

**Key Quote:** "Uncertainty is the game. You don't eliminate it, you manage it. So, if things feel like they're on fire every day… you're not failing. You're just playing the game."

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

This connects to:
- **Ergodicity** concepts in decision-making (managing non-recoverable vs. recoverable risks)
- **Antifragility** (Taleb) - benefiting from uncertainty and volatility
- **Optionality** - creating multiple pathways in uncertain environments
- **Risk vs. Uncertainty distinction** (Knight) - entrepreneurship operates in unmeasurable uncertainty
- **[[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty, to explain parts of the world that we can't explain]]** - entrepreneurship requires holding beliefs about uncertain futures without eliminating the uncertainty itself
