# AI-generated media destroys shared reality anchors forcing reliance on loudest voices

Realistic AI images/videos eliminate certainty about what's real. Without trusted reality anchors, individuals revert to trusting only direct experience and the loudest-screamed stories. Individuals can't be heard over millions of attention-optimized bots. We lose shared objective reality and return to competing tribal narratives.

## Connections
- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - uncertainty management mechanism
- [[Reference Frames create reality]] - competing reality frameworks
- [[Social Media uses Intermittent Variable Reinforcement (IVR)]] - attention hijacking
- [[Finding a confirmation of the belief creates a spike of Dopamine]] - tribal epistemology reinforcement

## Insight Type
Personal Theory / Pattern Recognition

## What Makes This Unique
Identifies AI-generated content not just as "deepfakes" but as systematic destruction of trust in objective reality, forcing regression to tribal epistemology (trust only direct experience and loudest narratives).
