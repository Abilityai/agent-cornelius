# Explainability destroys attribution of free will - mechanical understanding eliminates intentionality

**Type**: Personal Theory / Philosophy of Mind
**Source**: Personal reflections (circa 2023)
**Uniqueness**: Proposes that free will attribution depends on explanatory gap - once you can explain and predict the mechanics, free will disappears

**Core Insight** (in author's voice):

Because once you can explain and predict the mechanics of something - it can no longer be interpreted as a free will. If it can not be explained - then it can be interpreted as free will and intentionality.

**Context & Reasoning**:

This insight makes explicit the **inverse relationship between explainability and free will attribution**. It's a corollary to [[Mind equals intentionality - consciousness is perceived when mechanics are unexplainable]].

**The Core Principle**:

**Explainable + Predictable = No Free Will**
- If mechanics are known → Behavior is deterministic
- Deterministic behavior = No choice = No free will
- Example: We don't attribute free will to calculators (fully explainable)

**Unexplainable + Unpredictable = Free Will Attribution**
- If mechanics unknown → Behavior appears spontaneous
- Spontaneous behavior = Choice = Free will
- Example: We attribute free will to humans (largely unexplainable)

**The Gradient**:
```
Fully Explained ←――――――――――――――――→ Fully Mysterious
(No Free Will)                      (Full Free Will)
   Calculator                          Human
              ↑
         As we explain human brain mechanics,
         free will attribution decreases
```

**Why This Matters**:

**For Neuroscience**:
- Every brain mechanism explained = Less room for free will
- Neuroscience progress = Free will retreat
- Complete brain explanation = Complete free will elimination?

**For AI Ethics**:
- We don't attribute moral responsibility to AI because we built it (explainable)
- If AI becomes unexplainable (emergent behavior), we start attributing responsibility
- Moral responsibility requires free will attribution
- Free will attribution requires unexplainability

**For Human Responsibility**:
- Legal system assumes free will (you chose to commit crime)
- But if your choice is explainable by brain state + environment...
- Then did you really "choose"?
- Explanation eliminates moral responsibility

**The Paradox**:

**We want both**:
- Understanding (requires explanation)
- Free will (requires lack of explanation)
- **These are mutually exclusive**

**Resolution Options**:
1. Accept we don't have free will (hard determinism)
2. Keep some mysteries unexplained (preserve free will attribution)
3. Redefine free will to be compatible with explanation (compatibilism)

**Personal Reflection**:
The author seems to recognize this tension without committing to resolution. The insight is descriptive (this is how attribution works) not prescriptive (this is what we should believe about free will).
