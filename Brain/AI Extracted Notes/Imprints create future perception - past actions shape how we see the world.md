**Core Insight**:

How we see the world around us, our perception of how it acts towards us, is fully decided by imprints we created in our mind before with the actions and thoughts we had. Imprints from the past have long effects and their weight can go up over time.

**Context & Reasoning**:

This is a cognitive mechanism for karma that bypasses mysticism: **actions create mental imprints (patterns/habits) that shape future perception**.

**The mechanism**:
1. You perform action X with thought Y
2. This creates imprint (neural pattern, habit, expectation)
3. Imprint shapes future perception (what you notice, how you interpret)
4. Perception shapes experience (self-fulfilling prophecy)
5. Imprints compound over time (weight increases)

**Example**: If you repeatedly act with suspicion, you create "suspicion imprints" that make you interpret neutral behaviors as threatening. The world appears hostile not because it IS hostile, but because your imprints filter perception toward threat detection.

This parallels:
- **Confirmation bias** (seeking what validates existing patterns)
- **Neuroplasticity** (repeated actions strengthen neural pathways)
- **Self-fulfilling prophecy** (expectations shape outcomes)

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Confirmation Bias]] - Imprints create confirmation-seeking patterns
- [[Emptiness as hidden potential - things are empty of inherent meaning]] - Imprints fill emptiness with specific meanings
- [[Habits]] - Imprints are cognitive/perceptual habits
- [[Learning]] - Learning as deliberate imprint creation
- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - Imprints create beliefs that filter uncertainty
- [[Finding a confirmation of the belief creates a spike of Dopamine]] - Imprints create expectation patterns that dopamine confirms
