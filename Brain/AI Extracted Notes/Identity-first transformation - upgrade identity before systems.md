Your current identity produces your current results. To scale, upgrade identity before upgrading systems. Act from your future self, not present limitations. Identity can root in your past (default) or future. A bigger, more urgent future forces harder filtering of present activities. You don't scale a business - you scale a person.

## Why This Matters

This explains why most business advice fails: entrepreneurs try to layer new systems onto old identity. If you see yourself as "$2M company founder," you'll make $2M decisions even with $20M frameworks. The Frame-Floor-Focus framework works because Frame (impossible goal) forces Floor (identity death of what you're leaving behind) before Focus (new systems). Build systems for your future self's behavior, not current self's patterns.

## Connections

- [[Identity is a set of Beliefs]] - Scaling requires belief system overhaul, not just behavior change
- [[Finding a confirmation of belief creates dopamine spike]] - Old identity fights new goals through dopamine reinforcement of familiar patterns
- [[Self is an illusion created by conceptualization]] - Buddhist perspective: attachment to "who I am" blocks transformation into "who I'm becoming"
- [[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]] - Letting go of fixed identity enables radical transformation
- [[Identity is a set of beliefs about the world]] - Future self requires new belief system about what's possible and what matters
- [[Dopamine Explains Why Changing Beliefs Is Neurologically Painful]] - Identity transformation triggers dopamine resistance because beliefs = identity

## Practical Application

Hire for where you're going, not current state. Identify work only you can do at highest value (Zone of Genius). Everything else becomes elimination candidate or delegation opportunity. Make decisions aligned with 10x version of yourself: "Does this serve my future?"
