**Core Insight**:

Meaning comes from helping others. Purpose and fulfillment arise not from personal achievement but from service to others.

---

**Context & Reasoning**:

This is a **direct, unqualified claim** embedded in The Diamond Cutter's framework:

**Why helping others creates meaning** (Buddhist perspective):
1. **Breaks self-illusion** - Focus shifts from constructed "self" to interconnection
2. **Creates positive imprints** - Compassionate action shapes perception toward compassion
3. **Reduces suffering** - Both yours (through service) and others' (through help)
4. **Aligns intention** - Service naturally cultivates beneficial intentions (compassion, selflessness)
5. **Transcends emptiness** - Fills inherent emptiness with chosen purpose

**Contrast with other meaning sources**:
- **Achievement** - Temporary dopamine, comparison-based, self-focused
- **Understanding** - Intellectual satisfaction, often isolated
- **Pleasure** - Hedonic treadmill, diminishing returns
- **Service** - Sustainable, connection-based, other-focused

This parallels:
- **Existentialism** - Creating meaning through chosen values
- **Evolutionary psychology** - Cooperation/altruism as adaptive
- **Positive psychology** - Contribution as wellbeing pillar
- **Religious traditions** - Service as spiritual practice across cultures

**Practical application**:
The imprints framework suggests: helping others creates **perceptual imprints** that make you see opportunities to help, which creates more helping, which strengthens meaning - a virtuous cycle.
