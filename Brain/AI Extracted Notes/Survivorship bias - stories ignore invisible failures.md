**Core Insight** (in Eugene's voice):

"Humans think in terms of stories. We tell them to others. There's even such a thing as Narrative Bias - a natural tendency for people to interpret information as part of a larger story or pattern, regardless of whether the facts support the overall narrative. Every time you hear a story about someone who achieved something great, remember that you're only hearing that story because of their success and not hearing all the other voices of people who failed while doing the same thing."

**Context & Reasoning**:

Eugene explains survivorship bias through the classic WWII airplane example, then makes it visceral with examples:

**The Selection Problem**:
"The logical error of making decisions based on the data that went through the selection process in some form and ignoring the missing data points is called Survivorship bias (SB)."

**Why Stories Lie (Eugene's Examples)**:

**College Dropouts:**
"All those college dropouts who started unicorns - how many of them ended up as fast food workers?"

**Startup Successes:**
"All those examples of successful companies that made millions - how many ended up in bankruptcy before the market even got to see their product?"

**Instagram Influencers:**
"All those Instagram influencers that you see every day - how many of them you don't see, because they are busy working real jobs to make a living?"

**Core Mechanism**:
1. Success is rare (small percentage)
2. Success is visible (gets attention, media coverage)
3. Failure is common (large percentage)
4. Failure is invisible (no coverage, no story, disappears)
5. Stories sample only from successes
6. Creates false impression of probability

**Eugene's Key Warning**:
"Focusing on success stories doesn't take into account the base rates and gives a false impression that success is easier than it's. This leads to overconfidence - one of the most damaging traits for founders."

**Connection to Missing Data**:
Eugene references David J. Hand's "Dark Data: Why What You Don't Know Matters" as showing "very concrete strategies for dealing with it."

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Narrative fallacy]] - Why we create stories from random patterns
- [[Base rate neglect]] - Ignoring probability in favor of specific stories
- [[Overconfidence bias]] - Result of seeing only success stories
- [[Causal thinking]] - Stories imply causation from correlation
- [[Selection bias]] - General class of incomplete data errors
