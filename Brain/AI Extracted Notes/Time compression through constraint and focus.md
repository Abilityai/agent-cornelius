Reframe time as distance, not duration. Compress timelines through bold decisions and focused energy. Progress stems from decision quality and learning velocity, not clock hours. Set impossible deadlines to force creative focus: thinking 3 months? Try 30 days. Your 10-year goal? How could you do it in 3 years or less?

## Why This Matters

Time compression creates forcing functions that eliminate low-leverage activities automatically. When Mark Young had unlimited time to reach $20M, he spent 30 years getting there. When he compressed his next goal to 6 weeks, he generated $50M in new pipeline. The constraint didn't just speed execution - it revealed what actually mattered by making everything else impossible to pursue.

## Connections

- [[Impossible goals create clarity through elimination]] - Time compression is the mechanism that activates goal-based filtering
- [[Dopamine]] - Compressed timelines may increase dopamine urgency, overriding procrastination
- [[Flow is a selfless state]] - Extreme time pressure can trigger flow by eliminating self-doubt and analysis paralysis
- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - Aggressive deadlines reduce uncertainty by forcing commitment to single pathway
- [[Creativity requires limits, not an empty page]] - Time compression provides the ultimate constraint that forces creative breakthrough

## Mechanism

Compressed timelines force reverse-engineering from outcome. With 10 years, you can afford mistakes and exploration. With 3 months, you must identify the exponential lever immediately and eliminate everything else. The constraint creates clarity through necessity.
