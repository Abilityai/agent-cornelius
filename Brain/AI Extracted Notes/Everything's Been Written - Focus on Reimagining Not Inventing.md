## Core Insight

All models already exist (Greek myths everywhere). Don't need to invent, can reimagine. Use familiar references subversively.

## Context & Reasoning

The contrarian approach to creativity: Stop trying to invent wholly original ideas (impossible and unnecessary), focus instead on reimagining existing patterns in new contexts.

**The Observation**: Greek myths, archetypal stories, fundamental patterns recur across all cultures and eras. Hero's journey. Creation myths. Trickster figures. These are cognitive universals, not inventions.

**The Strategy**:
1. **Recognize patterns**: Identify archetypal structures in your domain
2. **Transplant contexts**: Move familiar patterns to unfamiliar settings
3. **Subvert expectations**: Use familiar references but twist outcomes
4. **Combine differently**: Novel combinations of existing elements

**Why it works**: Familiar patterns provide instant recognition and connection. The novelty comes from unexpected application, not wholly original creation. This is how most "new" ideas actually work - recombination rather than creation.

The pressure to be "original" often paralyzes. The freedom to reimagine liberates.
