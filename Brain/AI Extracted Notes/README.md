# AI Extracted Notes

This folder contains permanent notes that were automatically extracted by the **Insight Extractor Agent** from various content sources.

## Purpose

- **Organization**: Separates AI-harvested insights from manually created permanent notes
- **Provenance**: Clear attribution showing these were extracted by AI
- **Treatment**: These are treated as permanent notes with the same structure and importance as manual notes

## Note Structure

All notes in this folder follow the standard permanent note format:

- **Title**: Concise, memorable title capturing the unique perspective
- **Type**: Personal Theory / Contrarian View / Synthesis / Experience Wisdom / Mental Model / Pattern / Value Discovery
- **Source**: Original file path, section, or post identifier
- **Uniqueness**: What makes this distinctively the author's thinking
- **Extracted By**: AI (insight-extractor agent)
- **Extraction Date**: When the insight was extracted
- **Keywords**: Tagged with #ai-extracted plus content-specific tags

## Integration

These notes are:
- ✅ Searchable via Smart Connections semantic search
- ✅ Linkable from other notes
- ✅ Included in connection graphs
- ✅ Available for article synthesis
- ✅ Tagged for filtering (#ai-extracted)

## Quality Control

The Insight Extractor Agent:
1. **Always searches for duplicates** before creating notes (mandatory deduplication)
2. **Evaluates originality** using intelligent judgment beyond similarity scores
3. **Preserves authentic voice** from source material
4. **Documents reasoning** for why insights were extracted
5. **Creates changelogs** for each extraction session

## Relationship to Manual Permanent Notes

**Manual Permanent Notes** (`/Brain/Permanent Notes/`):
- Created during reading, thinking, and manual synthesis
- Direct human judgment and formulation
- Personal cognitive processing

**AI Extracted Notes** (this folder):
- Extracted from existing content (LinkedIn posts, articles, conversations, etc.)
- AI identifies patterns and unique perspectives
- Harvests insights that might otherwise be lost

Both serve the knowledge graph and can be linked, referenced, and synthesized together.
