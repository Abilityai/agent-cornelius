# Perception is a network of expectations - we see what we expect to see

**Type**: Personal Theory / Epistemology
**Source**: Personal reflections (circa 2023)
**Uniqueness**: Frames perception not as passive reception but as active expectation fulfillment - reality is filtered through predictive models

**Core Insight** (in author's voice):

Our perception of a reality is a network of expectations. The way we see it is the way we expect to see it.

---

**Context & Reasoning**:

This insight proposes that **perception is fundamentally predictive** rather than receptive. We don't simply "see what's there" - we see what our network of expectations tells us should be there.

**The Mechanism**:
- Perception = Active expectation matching, not passive data collection
- Reality = Filtered through pre-existing predictive models
- "Seeing" = Confirming or updating expectations

**Implications**:

**For Consciousness**:
- We construct reality through expectation networks
- [[Focus vs Control - the matrix dichotomy of consciousness modes]] - Control mode operates through expectations
- Direct perception requires releasing expectation networks

**For Belief Systems**:
- Beliefs shape what we can perceive
- Confirmation bias = Expectation-driven perception
- Changing beliefs = Rewiring expectation networks

**For Learning**:
- New information must fit or break existing expectations
- Surprise = Expectation violation
- Understanding = Integrating into expectation network

**Connection to Matrix Concept**:
The "matrix" (from [[Focus vs Control - the matrix dichotomy of consciousness modes]]) IS this network of expectations. Being "inside the matrix" means perceiving through expectation filters. Being "outside the matrix" (focus mode) means perceiving directly without expectation mediation.

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Focus vs Control - the matrix dichotomy of consciousness modes]] - Matrix as expectation network
- Related to predictive processing theories in neuroscience
- Related to Buddhist concepts of conceptual overlay on reality
