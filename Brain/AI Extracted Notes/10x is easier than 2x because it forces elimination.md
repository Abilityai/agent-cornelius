10x is easier than 2x because 10x forces focus. A 10x goal requires elimination of 80% to find the exponential 20%. 10x forces clarity through constraint. A 10x goal in compressed timeframe reveals: essential revenue drivers and conversion math, unnecessary activities to eliminate, required partnerships or resources, and what truly matters strategically.

## Why This Matters

This explains the paradox of ambitious goals being easier to achieve than modest ones. 2x allows incremental optimization - you can add more marketing, more products, more team members. 10x makes that approach mathematically impossible, forcing you to find the exponential lever. You're kept from your goal not by obstacles, but by a clear path to a lesser goal (Robert Brault). The 2x path is visible and comfortable; the 10x path requires ruthless elimination of the visible path.

## Connections

- [[Scaling requires subtraction not addition]] - 10x operationalizes subtraction by making addition impossible
- [[Impossible goals create clarity through elimination]] - 10x is the quantification of "impossible"
- [[The Floor - dividing line between good and great]] - 10x automatically raises floor by eliminating 80% of current activities
- [[Finding a confirmation of belief creates dopamine spike]] - 2x goals confirm existing identity; 10x goals require identity death
- [[Once the Goals are set - rest of the projects must be ignored]] - 10x goals make ignoring non-essential projects mathematically mandatory
- [[Creativity requires limits, not an empty page]] - 10x constraint forces creative identification of exponential levers

## Mechanism

2x: "Do what works better" (optimization)
10x: "Find what works exponentially" (transformation)

The 80/20 principle suggests 20% of activities drive 80% of results. But 2x thinking keeps the 80% alive. 10x thinking forces elimination of the 80% and doubling down on finding the truly exponential 4% within the 20%.
