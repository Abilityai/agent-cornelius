# Knowledge Decay in Rapidly Evolving Fields

In rapidly evolving technological domains (especially AI/agents), knowledge and mental models become obsolete within 6 months. This creates a paradox: smart people make wrong decisions because they're operating on outdated understanding while believing they're informed.

## The 6-Month Obsolescence Problem

If you experimented with AI agents 6 months ago and formed conclusions about their readiness or capabilities, that mental picture is fundamentally outdated. The pace of change in AI is unprecedented in human history - what was true half a year ago is no longer valid.

## Why This Matters for Decision-Making

Decision-makers face an impossible constraint:
- They have day jobs (managing teams, driving growth, achieving profitability)
- They cannot dedicate daily time to tracking AI developments
- **Therefore**: Zero chance of staying current without full-time focus
- **Result**: High-confidence decisions based on obsolete information

## The Daily Engagement Requirement

"If you are not doing this stuff daily, like literally working with agents on a daily basis, there is zero chance you're gonna be up to date with what's happening. And if you're zero chance you're up to date with what's happening, there is no chance you're gonna make the right decisions in this environment."

This isn't hyperbole - it's structural reality in exponentially evolving fields.

## Strategic Implications

1. **Internal expertise requires full-time dedication** - part-time tracking fails
2. **Outsourced expertise becomes necessary** - not optional luxury
3. **Past experience creates dangerous confidence** - "we tried this 6 months ago" is misleading
4. **Competitive advantage shifts** - those with daily engagement win

## Connections

- [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical]] - outdated mental models reinforce resistance
- [[Companies want builders not coders]] - expertise requires doing, not just learning
- [[Professional identity creates AI resistance]] - admitting knowledge is outdated threatens expertise-based identity
- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]] - outdated beliefs provide false certainty

## Questions Raised

- At what rate of technological change does knowledge decay become the dominant factor in decision quality?
- How do you distinguish between "technology not ready" vs "my understanding is outdated"?
- Can organizational structures adapt fast enough when core assumptions change every 6 months?
- Does this create a new form of competitive moat: continuous learning infrastructure?
