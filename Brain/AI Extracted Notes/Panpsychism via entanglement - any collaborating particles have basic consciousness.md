**Core Insight**:

"This also might mean that any groups of particles that collaborate with the world through any means have some sort of basic consciousness."

If consciousness emerges from entanglement networks (particles sharing information about the world), then any entangled system possesses rudimentary consciousness proportional to the complexity of its entanglement network.

**Context & Reasoning**:

**The Argument:**

1. **Premise 1:** Consciousness emerges from quantum entanglement networks
2. **Premise 2:** Entanglement occurs whenever particles interact/collaborate
3. **Conclusion:** Any interacting particles create minimal form of consciousness

**Spectrum of Consciousness:**
- **Simple entanglement** (2 particles) → Minimal awareness
- **Complex networks** (brain: ~86 billion neurons, each with ~10,000 synapses) → Human consciousness
- **Everything in between** → Gradations of consciousness

**This is panpsychism:** The view that consciousness is fundamental and ubiquitous, not emerging only at certain complexity thresholds.

**Implications**:

1. **No hard boundary:** No sharp line where consciousness "turns on"
2. **Consciousness as spectrum:** From fundamental particles to complex organisms
3. **Integration problem:** What makes certain entanglement networks (brains) feel unified?
4. **Ethical considerations:** If rocks have minimal consciousness, what does this mean?

**Comparison to Existing Panpsychism:**

**Traditional panpsychism:** Consciousness is fundamental property of matter (like mass, charge)

**Entanglement panpsychism (this theory):** Consciousness emerges from **relational property** (entanglement), not intrinsic property

**Key difference:** Consciousness isn't "in" particles but "between" them - aligns better with Buddhist emptiness (relational reality)

---

**Critical Objections**:

1. **Combination problem:** How do many micro-consciousnesses combine into unified experience?
2. **Decoherence problem:** Quantum entanglement fragile at macro scales (especially in warm, biological systems)
3. **Explanatory gap:** Even if true, doesn't explain **why** entanglement feels like something
4. **Testability:** How would we detect or measure "basic consciousness"?

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Consciousness as entanglement network - mind emerges from particles sharing world information]] - Full framework this derives from
- [[Quantum entanglement mirrors Buddhist emptiness - properties exist only in relation]] - Relational basis for consciousness
- [[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]] - Panpsychism compatible with no-self (consciousness without subjects)
- [[Theory of Mind could be one of the ways to lose self]] - Theory of mind as recognizing consciousness in entanglement networks?

**Status:** Highly speculative philosophical position. Interesting implication of entanglement-consciousness theory but faces severe theoretical and empirical challenges.
