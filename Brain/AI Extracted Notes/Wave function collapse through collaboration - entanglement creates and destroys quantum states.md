**Source**: Personal theory on quantum consciousness

**Core Insight**:

"Collapse of the wave function in the real world clearly happens. Particles collaborate and pass the properties of each other, and this creates the physical universe. Each collaboration creates entanglement and yet each collaboration also collapses the wave function of the previously entangled particles."

Physical reality emerges through ongoing cycle: particles collaborate → create entanglement → collapse previous states → create new entanglement → cycle repeats.

**Context & Reasoning**:

**The Collaboration-Collapse Cycle:**

1. **Initial state:** Particles in quantum superposition (multiple possible states)
2. **Collaboration occurs:** Particles interact/entangle
3. **Collapse happens:** Superposition resolves to definite state
4. **New entanglement:** Particles now correlated with each other
5. **New interaction:** Either particle interacts with third particle
6. **Previous collapse:** Earlier entanglement relationship disrupted/collapsed
7. **Cycle continues:** Ongoing creation and destruction of quantum relationships

**Key Insight:** Collapse isn't special "measurement" event requiring conscious observer. It's **continuous process** through particle interactions.

**Relationship to Quantum Measurement Problem**:

**Standard interpretations:**
- **Copenhagen:** Wave function collapse requires measurement/observation
- **Many-Worlds:** No collapse; all possibilities realized in parallel universes
- **Decoherence:** Environment interactions cause apparent collapse

**This theory's position:** Closest to **decoherence** - collapse through environmental interaction. But adds: these interactions create **physical reality itself** through entanglement networks.

**Unique claim:** Physical universe isn't pre-existing substrate where collapses happen. Universe IS the ongoing pattern of collapses and entanglements.

---

**Implications**:

1. **Reality as process:** Universe isn't static collection of particles; it's dynamic network of quantum relationships forming and dissolving
2. **No fundamental solidity:** What seems solid is rapid cycling of collapse-entanglement
3. **Consciousness as special case:** Human consciousness = complex entanglement network that persists (somewhat) despite continuous micro-collapses
4. **Time's arrow:** Collapse events might define direction of time (irreversible entanglement creation)

**Buddhist Parallel**:

**Buddhism:** "Everything is in constant state of change, flux" - nothing has permanent existence

**This quantum model:** Reality is continuous collaboration-collapse cycle - no permanent states, only ongoing processes

**Synthesis:** Buddhist impermanence might describe same reality quantum mechanics reveals - nothing exists independently or permanently, only relational processes.

---

**Questions Raised**:

1. **What defines "collaboration"?** Any interaction? Specific types? Threshold strength?
2. **Persistence of entanglement:** If each new interaction collapses previous entanglement, how do stable patterns (like atoms, molecules, organisms) persist?
3. **Consciousness stability:** How does conscious experience feel continuous if underlying quantum states constantly collapsing?
4. **Information preservation:** If states collapse, how is information maintained? (Decoherence preserves classical information even as quantum coherence lost)

**Potential Connections**:
- [[Buddhism teaches that Everything is in the constant state of change, flux]] - Perfect parallel to continuous collapse-entanglement cycle
- [[Consciousness as entanglement network - mind emerges from particles sharing world information]] - How consciousness maintains coherence despite collapse?
- [[Quantum entanglement mirrors Buddhist emptiness - properties exist only in relation]] - Properties only exist in moments of entanglement
- [[Perception as entanglement chain - seeing is multi-stage quantum collaboration]] - Each stage involves collapse of previous entanglement
- [[Mortality is what gives things and beings real value]] - Collapse = quantum "death" that enables new entanglement = new possibility

**Framework Strength:** Provides dynamic model of reality generation rather than static picture. Compatible with standard quantum mechanics (decoherence).

**Framework Weakness:** Doesn't solve hard problem (why entanglement feels like something). Needs more rigorous development of what counts as "collaboration."
