**Core Insight** (in Eugene's voice):

"Hallucinations. LLMs can confidently make mistakes - they still tend to hallucinate and give confident but wrong answers when they don't know certain things."

And the organizational consequence:

"Lack of accountability. As AI agents become more involved in enterprise decision making, it can become more difficult to assign responsibility when mistakes occur, complicating liability issues."

**Context & Reasoning**:

Eugene identifies hallucination as one of the "most serious problems" preventing LLMs from making business decisions, despite their superior consistency (lower noise than humans).

**The Problem**:
- LLMs don't say "I don't know"
- They generate plausible-sounding but false information
- Confidence level doesn't correlate with accuracy
- **Most dangerous**: Confident wrongness

**Why It Matters for Business**:
1. **Trust erosion**: Can't rely on LLM outputs without verification
2. **Accountability gap**: Who's responsible when AI makes confident but wrong decision?
3. **Liability complexity**: Traditional fault assignment breaks down
4. **Decision risk**: Low noise (consistency) masks high error risk

**Other Critical Problems Eugene Lists**:
- **Size of context**: Best decisions need large, diverse context (much hard to verbalize, like body language)
- **Limited context window**: Information window constrained by max tokens
- **Bias and discrimination**: AI perpetuates training data biases, leading to unfair decisions

**Paradox Eugene Identifies**:
- LLMs have **lower noise** than humans (more consistent)
- LLMs have **high hallucination risk** (confidently wrong)
- Result: Consistently confident but potentially consistently wrong

**Potential Connections**:
- [[LLMs exhibit significantly lower decision noise than humans]] - The noise advantage doesn't solve hallucination
- [[Consistency vs accuracy distinction]] - Can be consistently wrong
- [[Accountability in AI systems]] - Who's responsible for AI mistakes?
- [[Confidence calibration]] - Mismatch between confidence and correctness
- [[Human-AI collaboration]] - Need human oversight for high-stakes decisions
