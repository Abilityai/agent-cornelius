## Insight

Companies don't want coders anymore, they want builders. The traditional developer career path (learn to code → junior dev → algorithm interviews → climb ladder) is being demolished by AI tools. The market now values what AI still struggles with: problem-solving, strategic thinking, system integration, technical communication, and effectively leveraging AI tools.

## Context

Eugene observes in real-time how career advice remains "stubbornly stuck" while the actual skills demanded have fundamentally shifted:

**Old Value:** Writing code, passing algorithm interviews, memorizing syntax
**New Value:** Prompt engineering, AI integration, rapid prototyping, human insight

Key realization: "Your advantage isn't beating AI at simple tasks, it's knowing how to work with AI effectively."

**Recommendations:**
1. Embrace AI tools instead of fearing them (understand strengths/weaknesses)
2. Practice communication relentlessly (explaining thinking, articulating complexity simply)
3. Continuously learn (new AI tools emerge weekly)

## Connection to Existing Knowledge

Integrates with:
- **Creative destruction** (Schumpeter) - technological shifts obsolete old skills
- **Comparative advantage** (Ricardo) - focus on what humans do better than AI
- **Complementary skills** - AI + human judgment > either alone
- **Meta-learning** - "skill of acquiring new skills" becomes primary skill
- **System 1 vs System 2** - AI excels at System 1 (pattern matching), humans add System 2 (strategic reasoning)

## Contrarian Element

Challenges both camps:
- **AI doomers**: "You'll be replaced" → No, you'll be complemented if you adapt
- **AI deniers**: "Just keep coding like before" → No, the game has changed
