# MOC - Dopamine and Reward Systems

> **Map of Content**
> This MOC organizes all notes related to dopamine, reward prediction, motivation, and addiction mechanisms.

## 🧠 Core Concept Note
[[Dopamine]] - Master hub note covering mechanisms, baseline vs peaks, addiction, and applications

## 📚 Source Material
- [[Dopamine Nation - Anna Lembke]] - Primary source on pleasure-pain balance and modern abundance
- [[The Molecule of More - Daniel Lieberman]] - Dopamine as molecule of desire and future-seeking
- [[Huberman Labs Podcasts]] - Neuroscience protocols and mechanisms

## ⚙️ Core Mechanisms

### Reward Prediction
- [[Brain/Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]] - How dopamine signals prediction errors
- [[Dopamine spikes reinforce previous actions and create Learning]]
- [[Uncertain Cue gives a higher Dopamine reward than certain one]]
- [[Uncertainty in itself is rewarding can create Dopamine spikes]]

### Pleasure-Pain Homeostasis
- [[Pleasure and Pain strive towards balancing each other in the brain]]
- [[With a lot of pleasure default balance shifts to pain and suffering]]
- [[Once Pleasure-Pain balance is leveled - brain keeps going inertially to the opposite side]]

### Tolerance and Addiction
- [[With repeated exposure to same stimulus Dopamine spikes weaken]]
- [[High-dopamine substances abuse can result in Anhedonia]]
- [[Dopamine causes addiction through the mechanism]]
- [[Social Media usage is a form of addiction]]

## 🎲 Intermittent Variable Reinforcement (IVR)

- [[The best way to get Dopamine is Intermittent Variable Reinforcement (IVR)]]
- [[Intermittent Variable Reinforcement (IVR) can create massive irrational behavior]]
- [[Social Media uses Intermittent Variable Reinforcement (IVR) to keep people posting new content]]
- [[Gambling]] - Classic example of IVR exploitation

## 🔗 Cross-Domain Connections

### To Identity & Belief
- [[Finding a confirmation of the belief creates a spike of Dopamine]]
- [[The Uncertainty-Dopamine-Belief Loop]]
- [[Dopamine Explains Why Changing Beliefs Is Neurologically Painful]]
- [[People strive to confirm beliefs that are part of their identity]]

### To Flow States
- [[Flow States and Dopamine - The Paradox of Motivated Selflessness]]
- [[Novelty drives Flow through Dopamine]] (if exists)
- [[Flow is a selfless state]] - Transcends dopamine-driven wanting

### To Social Media & Polarization
- [[Social Media feedback loops create spikes of Dopamine]]
- [[Social Media AI increases engagement by stimulating polarization]]
- [[Identity conflict is the best way to get attention]]

### To Buddhism & Consciousness
- Dopamine rewards confirmation and certainty
- [[Explanation is the way to categorize the world and it creates Duhkha]]
- Craving (Duhkha) ≈ Dopamine-driven desire

## 📊 Substances & Interventions

### High-Dopamine Substances
- Caffeine: +30% baseline
- Chocolate: 1.5x baseline
- Sex: 2x baseline
- Nicotine: 2x (short-lived)
- Cocaine: 2.5x
- Amphetamine/Aderol: 10x
- [[Prediction - Aderol to everyone in 2030]]

### Healthy Interventions
- Exercise: 2x (if enjoyed)
- Cold water exposure: 2.5x sustained for hours (healthy!)
- [[Macuna Pruriens]], [[l-thyroxin]], [[PEA]], [[Huperzine-A]] - supplements

### Harmful Patterns
- [[Cocaine]] - long-term dopamine production damage
- [[Amphetamine]] - long-term dopamine production damage
- Bright light at night - crashes baseline
- [[Melatonin]] - may drop dopamine

## 🎯 Practical Applications

### Optimization Strategies
- Remove layering (multiple dopamine sources simultaneously)
- Intermittent reinforcement (don't celebrate every win)
- Learn to enjoy effort, not just outcomes ([[PFC]] control)
- Cold water exposure for baseline increase

### Warnings
- [[If you like something, and then start giving yourself a reward for this, and then take away the reward - you will stop liking the activity]]
- Don't spike dopamine before or after effort - engage it AT the effort
- Tolerance develops: More needed for same effect

## 🔬 Related Neurotransmitters & Systems
- [[Epinephrine (adrenaline)]] - Manufactured from dopamine
- [[Serotonin]] - Counterbalance through gratitude, meditation
- [[Prolactin]] - Opposite of dopamine (post-sex letdown)
- [[Oxytocin]] - Stimulates dopamine pathway (social connection)
- [[Glutamate]] - Released together with dopamine
