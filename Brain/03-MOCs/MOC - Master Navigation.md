## 🌊 Workflow Entry Points

### I have raw content to analyze
→ Use Insight Extractor agent
→ Creates folder in `00-Inbox/Content Extractions/`
→ See: [[WORKFLOW-GUIDE]]

### I want to find connections
→ Run `/find-connections {topic}` for specific exploration
→ Run Auto-Discovery agent for serendipitous patterns
→ Check `05-Meta/Changelogs/` for recent discoveries

### I want to write something
→ Check cluster MOCs above for theme
→ Browse `02-Permanent/` for related notes
→ Draft in `04-Output/Articles/` or `04-Output/LinkedIn Insights/`

### I need to find something
→ Use `/recall {query}` for semantic search
→ Use `/search-vault {keyword}` for quick lookup
→ Check MOCs for thematic browsing

## 🎯 Major Thematic Hubs

### 1. Consciousness & Self
**Core Thesis:** Self is illusion; enlightenment is direct perception
**Hub Note:** [[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]]
**Cluster MOC:** [[MOC - Buddhism and Consciousness]]

### 2. Dopamine & Motivation
**Core Thesis:** Dopamine drives motivation; modern abundance creates addiction
**Hub Note:** [[Dopamine]]
**Cluster MOC:** [[MOC - Dopamine and Reward Systems]]

### 3. Identity & Beliefs
**Core Thesis:** Identity is belief sets; confirmation creates dopamine addiction
**Hub Note:** [[Identity is a set of beliefs about the world]]
**Cluster MOC:** [[MOC - Identity and Belief Systems]]

### 4. Decision-Making & Biases
**Core Thesis:** Human judgment is systematically flawed; process over outcome
**Hub Note:** [[Noise is an undesirable variability of judgements]]
**Framework:** Mental Models Taxonomy (Lenses/Biases/Tools)

### 5. AI & Agents (Emerging)
**Core Thesis:** AI as species; agents as cognitive architecture
**Recent Insights:** `04-Output/LinkedIn Insights/` (2025-10-25 batch)
**Key Frameworks:** Folder Paradigm, Context Engineering, AI Species Recognition

### 6. Flow & Performance
**Core Thesis:** Flow is selfless state requiring autonomy, challenge-skill balance
**Hub Note:** [[Flow is a selfless state]]

## 🔬 Cross-Domain Bridges

Key notes that connect multiple domains:

- [[Finding a confirmation of the belief creates a spike of Dopamine]]
  Bridges: Identity ↔ Dopamine ↔ Decision-Making

- [[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty]]
  Bridges: Identity ↔ Decision-Making ↔ Buddhism

- [[Flow is a selfless state]]
  Bridges: Buddhism ↔ Performance ↔ Neuroscience

- [[Social Media uses Intermittent Variable Reinforcement (IVR)]]
  Bridges: Dopamine ↔ Identity ↔ Technology

## 📝 Original Frameworks Developed

Located in `04-Output/Frameworks/`:

1. **Mental Models Taxonomy** - Lenses 🔍 / Biases 🧠 / Tools 🛠️
2. **Safety as Velocity** - Psychological safety enables speed, not comfort
3. **Uncertainty-Dopamine-Belief Loop** - Why changing minds is neurologically painful
4. **Folder Paradigm** - Agents own directories as operational memory
5. **Context Engineering** - Perspective applied to information
6. **Self-Construction Stack** - Reality → Concepts → Beliefs → Identity → Self

**Navigation Philosophy:**

This MOC is your **home base**. Everything in your knowledge base is reachable from here through 1-2 clicks. Use thematic clusters for exploration, workflow entry points for action, and cross-domain bridges for synthesis.

The structure supports **asynchronous work** - jump in anywhere, anytime. No fixed workflow. Just clear paths for knowledge to flow.
