## Script:

OpenAI, Google, Anthropic. [PAUSE]

All hitting the same wall.

They thought more data plus more compute equals smarter AI.

Turns out? Wrong.

GPT-4 to Orion isn't the leap they promised. More training data doesn't fix fundamental limits.

The 2010s were about scaling. Now we're back to actual innovation.

**Reasoning**: Major AI companies hitting scaling plateau challenges the "more is better" narrative. Eugene's perspective: This validates that system architecture matters more than raw compute (connects to [[Most AI agents are chatbots with fancy wrappers]]). The industry's forced pivot from scaling to innovation aligns with Eugene's emphasis on creative problem-solving over brute force approaches.
