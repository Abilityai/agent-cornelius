## Script:

I've been hiring developers for years.

And I've watched what companies actually want completely shift.

They used to want coders. People who could write clean functions and pass algorithm interviews.

Now? They want builders.

People who can solve problems, communicate clearly, and leverage AI tools effectively.

Because AI can write the code. What it can't do is think strategically about what to build and why.

Your advantage isn't beating AI at coding. It's knowing how to orchestrate it.

## Delivery Notes:
- Personal, reflective opening | Emphasize "completely shift" | Contrast "used to want" vs "Now?" | Strong close on "orchestrate"

## Source & Reasoning:

**Source**: Eugene's insight [[Companies want builders not coders - AI shifts the skill demand]] + GitHub Copilot Workspace agent announcements and Microsoft Ignite AI agent features (November 2024)

**Reasoning**: With GitHub announcing Copilot agents that can write, test, and fix code autonomously, Eugene's observation about the shift from "coders" to "builders" is increasingly validated. GitHub's agent mode can "iterate on its own code, recognize errors, and fix them automatically" - exactly the routine coding tasks that no longer differentiate humans. Eugene's contrarian angle: this isn't about AI replacement, it's about skill evolution toward orchestration and strategic thinking.
