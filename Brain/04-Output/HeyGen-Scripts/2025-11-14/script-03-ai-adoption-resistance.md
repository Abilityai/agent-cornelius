## Script:

Everyone thinks AI adoption is a skills problem.

It's not.

It's a worldview problem.

Business owners aren't resisting the tools. They're resisting what the tools imply.

That growth doesn't mean more people. That org charts become optional. That one founder with agents can outperform a five-person team.

Adopting AI doesn't just require new skills. It requires letting go of how you think business should work.

That's the real bottleneck.

## Delivery Notes:
- Direct challenge in opening | [PAUSE] after "It's not" | Emphasize "imply" | Build energy through list | Firm close on "bottleneck"

## Source & Reasoning:

**Source**: Eugene's insight [[AI adoption bottleneck is psychological not technical - attachment to mental models]] + ongoing industry discussions about slow AI adoption despite available tools (November 2024)

**Reasoning**: News shows AI companies hitting technical walls, but Eugene's contrarian take is that the REAL wall is psychological. Connects Buddhist concept of attachment to business reality. While industry focuses on "upskilling," Eugene identifies the deeper issue: people are attached to mental models of how business "should" work. Uniquely bridges spiritual/psychological concepts with practical business challenges.
