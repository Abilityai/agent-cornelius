## Script:

Most AI agents are fake. [PAUSE]

They're chatbots with fancy wrappers.

Real agents? They make decisions. They take actions. They own outcomes.

Not just answer questions.

The difference comes down to six things: memory, state, clear tasks, tool strategy, responsibility framing, and feedback loops.

If your agent doesn't have these? You built a prompt, not a system.

The model is only one piece. Agents need architecture.

## Delivery Notes:
- [PAUSE] after "fake" | Emphasize "Real agents?" | List six things with slight speed increase | Strong close on "architecture"

## Source & Reasoning:

**Source**: Eugene's existing insight - [[Most AI agents are chatbots with fancy wrappers - system architecture matters]] + current AI agent hype in market (November 2024)

**Reasoning**: With Microsoft Ignite 2024 showcasing AI "agents" and GitHub announcing agent features, the market is flooded with products calling themselves agents. Eugene's 6-element framework (memory, state, task clarity, tool orchestration, responsibility framing, feedback loops) provides clear diagnostic criteria. Contrarian angle: challenges vendor marketing while offering practical framework.
