# When to Accept Non-Ergodic Risks?

The ergodicity concept explains why some risks are fatal (non-ergodic with absorbing barriers) while others aren't. But this raises an important distinction that isn't captured in the formal definition:

## Core Question

**What distinguishes a "smart" non-ergodic bet from a "stupid" one?**

## Context

Many valuable life opportunities ARE non-ergodic:
- Starting a company (can fail completely)
- Career changes (can set you back years)
- Having children (irreversible)
- Major relocations (high switching costs)

Yet we take some of these risks and avoid others. Why?

## Open Questions to Explore

1. Is there a framework for evaluating non-ergodic opportunities beyond "just diversify"?
2. Does the potential upside matter differently in non-ergodic vs ergodic situations?
3. How does personal financial runway/reserves change which non-ergodic bets are acceptable?
4. Are there "meta-ergodic" strategies - ways to make yourself more robust to non-ergodic shocks?
5. When does the Barbell Strategy apply to life decisions, not just investing?
