## Version 1 (489 chars)

The Grokipedia vs Wikipedia war misses the point entirely.

Bias isn't a bug—it's your brain's OS.

Finding confirmation of your beliefs? Dopamine hit.
Beliefs challenged? Dopamine withdrawal.

Wikipedia = Liberal consensus filter
Grokipedia = AI + Musk filter

Neither is "neutral." Neutral doesn't exist.

The solution isn't picking the "right" encyclopedia. It's recognizing ALL encyclopedias as perspective engines, not truth oracles.

Use multiple sources. Hold beliefs lightly. Notice when you're seeking confirmation, not truth.

## Version 2 - More provocative (474 chars)

Everyone arguing Grokipedia vs Wikipedia is "less biased" needs a neuroscience lesson.

Your brain REWARDS confirmation with dopamine.
It PUNISHES belief change with withdrawal.

That's why both sides feel they're "finally seeing the truth."

Wikipedia = human bias
Grokipedia = AI bias

Both are filtered. Neither is neutral.

The real skill? Using multiple sources while recognizing your brain is always seeking confirmation, not truth.

The map is never the territory.

## Version 3 - Question hook (496 chars)

Why can't anyone agree on Grokipedia vs Wikipedia?

Neuroscience answer: Your brain gives you dopamine for confirming beliefs and withdrawal for challenging them.

Musk fans: "Unbiased truth!"
Critics: "Different bias!"

Both are neurologically addicted to being right.

The uncomfortable truth: Neither encyclopedia is "neutral." All knowledge is filtered through perspectives.

Wikipedia = liberal consensus
Grokipedia = AI + Musk's views

Solution: Use both. Hold beliefs lightly. Recognize when you're seeking confirmation, not truth.
