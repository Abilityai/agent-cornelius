Following the Eugene Personal Brand Visual Guide
Brand Colors: Soft red (#FFE6E6), Red (#FF0000), Dark gray (#363B45), Light gray (#F0F0F0)

===================================================================

OPTION 1: "AUTONOMY vs CONTROL" THEME (Main Video Focus)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a YouTube thumbnail for AI coding tools analysis. Use a gradient background transitioning from soft pale red at top-left to light gray at bottom-right. Add VERY LARGE bold text "CURSOR 2.0" at the top in bright red color using DM Sans font at bold weight. Below that, add VERY LARGE bold text "MORE AUTONOMY = LESS CONTROL" with "MORE AUTONOMY" in bright red color and "LESS CONTROL" in dark gray color. Position text slightly left of center, occupying 75% of the frame. Include a semi-transparent white card overlay behind the text with rounded corners and subtle shadow. On the right side, add minimal geometric elements suggesting a balance scale or seesaw tilting toward autonomy - simple lines and shapes in red. Maintain professional, tech-forward aesthetic with plenty of negative space. Text must be readable when thumbnail is viewed at very small sizes.

===================================================================

OPTION 2: "AGENT-FIRST INTERFACE" THEME
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Design YouTube thumbnail for coding tool interface review. Soft red gradient background fading to light gray. VERY LARGE main headline "CURSOR 2.0" at top in bright red color using bold DM Sans font. Below that, add VERY LARGE text "AGENTS IN THE CENTER" with "AGENTS" emphasized in bright red color, rest in dark gray color. Subtext below: "Not Code Anymore" in smaller dark gray text. Text positioned left-of-center, occupying 75% of horizontal space. Semi-transparent white card overlay with rounded corners behind text. On right side, add simple geometric representation of a centered circle (agent) with surrounding squares (code) pushed to edges - minimal line art in thin red. Light drop shadows for depth. Clean, minimal design with negative space. Professional tech aesthetic. Text must be readable when thumbnail is tiny.

===================================================================

OPTION 3: "HOW AI TAKES OVER" THEME (Eugene's Key Quote)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Create YouTube thumbnail for AI future analysis. Gradient background from soft pale red to white with subtle radial overlay. At top, add VERY LARGE bold text "CURSOR 2.0" in bright red color using DM Sans bold weight. Below that, add VERY LARGE bold text "THIS IS HOW AI TAKES OVER" with "TAKES OVER" in bright red color and rest in dark gray color. Secondary text below: "One Autonomous Step at a Time" in smaller dark gray. Text occupies 75% of frame, positioned slightly left of center. Semi-transparent white card behind text with rounded corners and soft shadow. On right side, add minimal geometric element suggesting incremental steps or ladder - simple ascending lines or blocks in thin red. Professional, analytical aesthetic with plenty of breathing room. Text must be readable when thumbnail is viewed at very small sizes. Modern, clean design.
