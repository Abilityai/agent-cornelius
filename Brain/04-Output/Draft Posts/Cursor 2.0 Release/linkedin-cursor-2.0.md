Cursor 2.0 dropped yesterday.

Here's what actually matters:

–––

**THE AUTONOMY SHIFT**

Multi-agent execution isn't just a feature.

It's Cursor betting on a specific future: more autonomous systems = more effective systems.

The more autonomy these agents get, the more control we have to give up.

And here's the thing—that's exactly what will make them win.

The scary part?

The more autonomous they become, the more effective they'll be. So the market will select for systems that push autonomy even further.

That is how artificial intelligence is gonna be taking over. Bit by bit.

**AGENTS AT THE CENTER**

They redesigned the interface.

Agents are now in the central position. Not the editor.

You can switch between the old way and the new way, but the default has changed.

Same shift we're seeing with Claude Code and other tools. The pattern is clear: agents first, code second.

**THE COMPOSER PLAY**

Introducing their "first agentic coding model" → 4x faster than similar intelligent models.

Pay attention to what they're NOT saying: "smartest model."

They're saying "fastest."

My read: probably smart context engineering + a fast LLM. Which is great. But their real game is obvious.

They want to become suppliers of raw intelligence instead of intermediaries between you and model providers.

Will I switch from Anthropic? Probably not. But I'll test it.

**SANDBOXING MATTERS**

These agents are getting more autonomy. Running in "yellow mode" where they can do pretty much anything.

You add stuff to the allow list for efficiency. But that means they can make mistakes and break your system.

Sandboxing is the answer.

I prefer Docker for complete isolation. They're sandboxing the terminal specifically—limiting it to a work directory and internet access.

Either way, sandboxing is a crucial feature as autonomy increases.

**THE BOTTOM LINE**

Cursor is refocusing the default option to more agentic interfaces.

• Interface redesigned around agents
• Trying to own the model layer (Composer)
• Building containment (sandboxing)
• Pushing for more autonomy

This autonomy focus is what the competition is working on too (Claude Code, etc.).

The game has changed. Tools are becoming orchestrators, not editors.

What level of autonomy are you comfortable giving your agents?
