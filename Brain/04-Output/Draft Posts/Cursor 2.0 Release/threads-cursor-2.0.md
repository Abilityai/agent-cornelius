Cursor 2.0 changed the interface.

Agents are now in the central position. Not the editor.

The default has shifted. Agents first. Code second.

This is how AI takes over. Not dramatically. Incrementally.

More autonomous systems will outcompete less autonomous ones. Every time.

The more autonomy you give up in the right way, the more advantage you get.

Cursor knows this. Claude Code knows this. The entire industry is betting on it.

And they're right.
