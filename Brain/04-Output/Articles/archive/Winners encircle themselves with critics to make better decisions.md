# Winners encircle themselves with critics to make better decisions
[[Leadership]] [[Business]] [[Entrepreneurship]] [[Decision Making]]
One of the crucial differences between a strong [[Leader]] and an ordinary one is the kind of people they surround themselves with. 🧑🏼‍💼 🙎🏽‍♂️ 👩‍💼

Every book on [[Decision Making]], every book on [[Leadership]], and every management consultant will tell you the same thing: If you surround yourself with agreeable Yes-men - you are going to lose.

Why? Where do I even start...

1️⃣ [[Confirmatory Group]]s create echo chambers of opinions that greatly amplify the effects of the [[Confirmation Bias]] and [[Desirability Bias]]. Basically, if you've agreeable people around you, you'll always be more convinced of your worldview and not question or check it often enough. This is one of the most essential conditions for effective decision making.

2️⃣ These groups will cause you to suffer [[Overconfidence effect]], which makes you stick to your original plans instead of changing course in time.

3️⃣ You won't notice your own biases, and others won't point them out to you. It's difficult for many people to recognize and get rid of their cognitive [[bias]]es, but easy for them to recognize them in the [[Judgment]] of others. Basically, we need others with a wildcard to disagree with us to make better [[decision]]s.

4️⃣ In Yes-man groups, you won't take the insightful opinions of others over the noise of your own genius. People will just agree with you and give up their critically evaluated thoughts.

Instead, non-confirmatory groups practice [[Constructive Conflict]] or Task [[Conflict]]. Mind you, not personal conflict directed against a personality, but "task conflict" over ideas and opinions. This approach triggers creativity, innovation, and better [[Decision Making]].

How do you create such an environment around you? - Surround yourself with people who're looking for the best answer, rather than feeling they're right; people who're willing to challenge your opinion, rather than yes-men who want to make you happy.

♦️ Create a safe space where you can learn something new when you're wrong, not when you're being punitive.

♦️ Make sure people don't get caught up in personal conflicts, but instead practice constructive engagement with things (ideas, opinions)

♦️ Encourage your team to challenge your thoughts and ideas and to catch yourself and others when you fall victim to various biases.

Engage your critics - and become stronger. Silence your critics - and become weaker ❗
