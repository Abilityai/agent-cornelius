# [[Dopamine]] Article

We all are slaves. Most of us (including me) don’t have have much control over what we want and what we do. And this is getting worse. If you don’t realize it - you are a blind man at the wheel. 

For a millions time on the wide planes of the Internet the topic of Dopamine is going to be discussed once more. You won’t find much ground braking in this set of articles, this is rather a summary of several hours of videos on Youtube and 3 dopamine-related books, that allowed me to look at the topic from different angles. And this is an attempt for put it on in a structured manner, which is first of all necessary for me to better memorize and operationalize the knowledge. 

My interest in Dopamine spiked together with a Dopamine itself… Thought this would be a nice, nerdy joke. If it does not make sense to you - read this article(s). 

But anyway, I knew for years there was a chemical named Dopamine, which is one of the main chemicals forming our behavior, somehow related to forming habits, addiction, and getting pleasure and excitement about things. After I dove into [[learning]] this topic I found out how much more it is that what I thought. It started with one video by [Huberman] - a neuroscientirst from [Harvard], and he managed to get me excited and interested in the topic so much, that I follow up with a number of other videos, articles and books. 

Disclaimer - I’m not a neuroscientist, I don’t have professional or educational background on this topic, except for processing some amount of material about it. 

Alright, enough prelude. Let’s begin. 

## What is it?

Dopamine is a chemical with a quite straightforward formula (which I plan to tattoo on my shoulder, if I ever get brave enough for this). It is released in particular areas of the brain, and it influences neurons in multiple different areas of the brain. Some call it a neuro-transmitter (narrow effects, used only to transmit signals between neurons), and others neuro-modulator (wider impact on neurons across the brain). 

In terms of its effects, there are so many of them that I struggle to even list them - every last one requires clarification. But think of it this way - everything you do beyond your skin and everything you feel that makes you motivated to do it is directly driven by Dopamine. Movement itself is impossible without Dopamine stimulation. 

It is in the core of making decisions and of being motivated. It dictates the level of motivation, desire and willingness to go through effort. 

It directs us to look for, want and strive for things outside ourselves. It forces us to look for novelty, explore, achieve. 

Put it another way - if you did not have Dopamine for whatever reason - you would not have motivation to even move, let alone go through the effort of achieving anything. You would not even reach for food, and could die starving. Even if the food was right in front of you. That is exactly what happened in the experiment with genetically altered mice, who did not want to come a few inches to get food and were dying starving. But if you put food in their mouth they would eat and enjoy it. 

To summarize, Dopamine is the source of motivation for basically anything outside ourselves, and it creates a feeling that life is about to get better. Right now, right after the next thing you want…

The most important misconception about Dopamine is that it is considered a molecule of pleasure. This is not exactly the case at all, this is a molecule of anticipation, craving, drive, motivation, excitement - sometimes those things can be experienced as pleasure. It will make us think we will like something when we get it, but it nothing to do with whether we are going to actually like it. That’s why it is such a normal thing to be super excited about getting something, and then be somewhat dissapointed after getting it. More about it below. 

## How it works biologically

This is so freaking hard to find a balance to give you the right amount of biological understanding of the topic, and not bore you to death. But enough wining. 

Roughly 1 in 20 million cells in the brain product Dopamine, but they have disproportionatly large impact on the brain. 

Wanting comes from the old part of the brain called [[Ventral Tegmental Area [[(VTA)]]]]. It is reach in Dopamine and it is one of two Dopamine producing regions. Cells that grow there have long dendrites that reach the [[Nucleus Accumben [[(NA)]]]]. This is called [[  Desire Circuit (  Mesolimbic [[Pathway)]]]]. When Wanting happens, neurons from VTA create a spike of Dopamine in NA, which creates the motivation. 

This circuit evolved to give us motivation to get food, sex and win competitions. It is activated by something attractive from the evolutionary or life-sustaining standpoint. It is activated no matter if you are hungry. The sensation is not a Wanting, but rather a reaction to something we encounter. 

The second crucial circuit is a [[Dopamine Control (Meso-cortical) [[Circuit]] Circuit]], which goes through Pre-frontal cortex - the part of the brain that does all the rational thinking, control and explaining. It does several things, but most importantly - allows to control impulses of Dopamine (make smart choices) and plan for achieving what we are craving. It is a “parent at the wheel” for Dopamine. It also allows to control the imagination, see into the future to control the consequences of our intended actions. 

Dopamine goes to both circuit simultaneously - [[  Desire Circuit (  Mesolimbic [[Pathway)]]]] and [[Dopamine Control (Meso-cortical) [[Circuit]] Circuit]] (Tenacity circuit). The first one creates the desire to get something, and the second one allows us to make a choice and plan for getting it. 

There’s a baseline level of [[Dopamine]] that is always circulating your brain, which is necessary for you to do … really anything, even move. And then there are spikes of Dopamine that make us feel exited and motivated to do something. 

Now in a super simple way, imagine there’s a small jar of Dopamine. It’s dripping a bit regularly to give you this baseline Dopamine. Then when your brain identifies something exciting (source of food, potential mate), this jar ejects peak level of dopamine into two tubes. One tube goes to the area of them brain that makes you want this thing soooo much that you are ready to do anything, and the other tube goes to the area that plans for getting it and can say NO to this potentially stupid idea. 

This jar analogy is useful, because one important thing to keep in mind is that after the spike of dopamine, there’s less of it in the jar, and so the baseline of it is dropped. And when the baseline of Dopamine drops, we tend to feel psychological pain and distress. 

After the peak the level of dopamine returns to Lower level than the baseline before the peak. Extent to which it goes under is proportional to the height of the peak. Eventually baseline will return to normal, though. 

Experiencing the same things over and over again drops the peaks levels - we develop tolerance. But different activities cause spikes of dopamine. And so peaks can come from a ton of activities, and if they are repeated one after another - the baseline of progressively dropping, which makes it harder and harder to experience excitement and “wanting” about really anything. 

Long-term consumption of high-dopamine substances leads to Dopamine Deficit state. Dopamine runs out, as well as dopamine sensitivity decreased - and nothing feels good anymore. This is called [[Anhedonia]]  - inability to enjoy pleasure of any kind. 

The level of motivation and excitement is relative to the baseline level, meaning that how much you are motivated is basically a difference between the hight of the peak and the level of baseline. 

Level of motivation under “normal” level or baseline Dopamine depends on the level of Dopamine before this moment, on previous peaks. This is due to the fact that Dopamine neurons tend to develop a tolerance to high levels of Dopamine. 

!!**Dopamine works together with [[Epinephrine (  adrenaline)  [[]]]]. Epinephrine is actually manufactured from dopamine. So level and peaks of those are correlated.** 

!!When dopamine system is at rest it fires 2-3 times per second. When it is excited - it goes to 20-30 times per second. When expected reward fails to materialize the rate falls to 0, which feels terrible. 

There’s an interesting model I picked up from one of the books. Brain divides world into Para-personal space (PPS) and Extra-personal space (EPS) - whatever is near (stretched hand, things we can control now) and whatever is far (beyond, whatever we can’t touch) respectively. And our brain works in different ways in those spaces, it uses different sets of hormones. 

For PPS there’s a lot of chemicals that control our experience - so-called Here-and-Now molecules ([[HnN]]). in EPS - the main chemical is Dopamine. 

Here-and-Now molecules are [[Serotonin]] , [[Oxytocin]] , [[Endorphin]]  (brain’s version of Morphine), [[Testosterone]] and [[Endocannabinoids]] (our brain’s marihuana). These molecules are responsible for the feeling of happiness with what you have right now. When you hug your loved ones, when you have a feeling that you are enough and what you have is enough, when you are just calmly happy with yourself and what’s immediately around you - HnN molecules are prevailing in your brain. 

Usually in this state you don’t want to go anywhere and get anything - you have enough, you are happy. That’s because Dopamine and HnN molecules are in reverse-correlation relationships - when Dopamine is up - HnN molecules are down, and vice-versa. 

Isn’t this ironic? You either strive for something, make something happen, change the world…. or you are happy. 

(@Oxytocin is stimulating Dopamine pathway. It is created from social connections.)

### Reward-Prediction Error [[Brain/Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]]

This part is my favorite, because it speaks about probably one of the most important mechanisms in the brain that directly facilitates learning and creating behaviors. Basically, if you do something from time to time, e.g. you like to each an avocado toast in the morning, or snore a line of cocaine before going to bed - both of those behaviors are created by this mechanism. 

This is called Cue-Dependent learning, Pavlovian conditioning or Reward-Prediction Error. Different names - same approach for shaping any behavior - harmful or otherwise. 

Whenever you wonder around and find something you like (food, drug, behavior), then you try it and like it, this triggers the release of Dopamine. This is an unexpected reward. This spike stimulates learning and forcing you to remember what you have done or seen right before this this stimulus that brought you so much pleasure. This way, the Cues (hints, triggers) are formed are memorized. 

Next time you run into this Cue, it creates a spike of Dopamine and excitement about what this Cue is associated with. Cue itself can be  anything in the environment or people around you. This cue creates a small anticipatory release of Dopamine, which motivates you to pursue the reward. 

You go for the reward, and if you get it, and it meets or exceeds your expectation - you get an even bigger spike of Dopamine. This spike stimulates the learning process, basically making you remember that the sequence Cue → Reward feels good, and that you should do that next time. 

If, however, the reward does not meet your expectations (you don’t like it) - Dopamine drops below the baseline, which feels awful. It triggers the opposite process, teaching your brain that this sequence of Cue → Reward is not as good for you, and next time you are less likely to execute this behavior. 

This simple algorithm creates a chain of behaviors and habits, that follow basic logic of Cue → Craving → Reward → Reinforcement.

It’s the same cycle discussed in dozens of books about Habits. 

The only way that really works for me in terms of changing the behavior is changing my environment, and by doing that, removing the Cues that triggered behaviors. In most cases, we don’t realize what are the Cues that make us execute on some behaviors, and so we can’t fix a harmful behavior. 

Important learning from this section is that Dopamine spike (Reward) or drop (punishment) are instruments of learning. This is how we get to know the world. Unexpected reward or punishment is Learning. To support this idea, research suggests that Dopamine spikes triggers neuroplasticity - brain forming new connections between neurons. 

There’s a physical process of forming Tolerance to any stimulus - behaviors or drugs. As I understand, there are two ways in which it happens. 

1. Dopamine receptors become less receptive to Dopamine spikes, so even the same amount of Dopamine does not make us feel as good
2. Since Dopamine is spiking as a response to Unexpected reward, or reward exceeding expectations - with repeated behaviors, the spike of dopamine becomes smaller and smaller. Unless, of course, we can come up with something new every time. Hence - a search for novelty.  

## What causes Dopamine release?

In any kind of categorization it is best to use a principle of Mutually Excluding and Collectively Exchaustive. Let me try it here, though with my limited knowledge I am guaranteed to miss something important. 

### Wired Behaviors

Here I’m talking about behaviors that are wired by nature to create an unexpected reward (read - Dopamine spike). At a basis, those behaviors are driven by the basic instincts, but then “upgraded” to more sophisticated thing through the use of our pre-frontal cortex and experience. This “upgrade” is very important - I would say for most of our behaviors we can’t even say how this might be related to basic instincts, but it still is.  

1. Survival behaviors - looking for food, water, shelter etc.. Simple examples - opening a fridge and getting a pack of delicious, chocolate ice cream (if you want it now - I just triggered your Cue and you are having a spike of Dopamine forcing you to want it and look for it). 
    1. Social and Dominance behaviors. I interpret it as part of the survival ones, as this is a core mechanism for people to survive. Things you do to establish your position in social hierarchy, compete and win. This is where Ego comes from, in my opinion. 
    2. Confirmation Behaviors. Research suggest that people get a spike of Dopamine if they find facts that confirm their beliefs. This is a whole separate topic I’m fascinated with - but for another article. I take it as a Survivorship behavior, because I think this is the basis for decision making in the group, which is required for people to survive. 
2. Mating behaviors - looking for someone to you-know-what. And all the behaviors related to that, e.g. putting make up or enlarging your penis. Sex itself tends to double the level of Dopamine. However, Prolactin is excreted in the body after sex and make us lay down and do nothing - it is the hormone that is basically opposite to Dopamine. During sex, Dopamine drives the initial arousal, but then brain switches to Here-and-Now molecules, and orgasm is almost entirely HnN experience. HnN shut down Dopamine during sex. Thus, for some high Dopamine people it is hard to turn off the thoughts and just experience the intimacy, and because of that they have problems with erection and orgasm. 

### Homeostasis disruptors

Sounds fancy, right? Damn, I can imagine how smart you might think I am. I just got my Dopamine shot. 🙂

This idea was described in the book called [[Dopamine Nation - Anna Lembke]], but it is not something new at all - human body prefers to keep things stable and in homeostasis, which means at a particular level. And it is thought that this baseline of Dopamine is this homeostatic level. If it goes up too much - we feel excitement, and body is trying to regulate it down. If Dopamine baseline goes down - we are in the world of psychological pain - and the body tries to regulate it up. It goes even further - if you are in pain yourself, your body is trying to compensate it by raising the Dopamine levels. 

Which means, that whenever you willingly expose yourself to a certain level of pain and discomfort - your body reacts, by increasing the level of baseline Dopamine in your body. This is where the runners’ high is coming from. Oh man, I miss this feeling so much - every time I was coming from a run, for a few hours I has so much energy, motivation and excitement. It was wining down gradually, yet it definitelly created a certain running addiction. Now I don’t run due to injury, and still miss this feeling. 

Same can be achieved with other physical exercise. Research suggests that an increase of 250% can be achieved after exercising, but only if you enjoy this particular kind of workout. This is fascinating. We can get this crazy increase, but only if we actually like it!

Similar effects are created by Cold Water Exposure - this is a proven method of raising your Dopamine. It is practiced now at every sport as a recovery technique. And research suggest 250% increase in baseline Dopamine after cold water exposure. Temperature and time can vary, but a healthy, sustained increase in dopamine can be achieved after exposure to the water at 5-6 Celsius for a few minutes. It is critical, that this is not a Peak dopamine, but a baseline Dopamine increase, that wears down during a few hours.

There’s a multitude of other such behaviors, that make you feel pain, and then reward you by flooding with Dopamine. 

## Substances

There’s a whole world of different substances that directly impact the level fo Dopamine, I will list the ones that I know of. 

Yes, there are things you can buy off the shelf that will give you a boost of Dopamine. But one thing to remember, is that after each spike of Dopamine, there’s a proportional drop. So you will feel more excited and motivated, but then you will feel miserable for a while. With this disclaimer, let’s get started. 

**Levodopa** (lDOPA) - this is precursor to Dopamine, which is basically a direct injection of Dopamine in your brain. The increase of Dopamine depends on the dosage you consume. Some substances listed below contain just that. 

**[[Caffeine]]** - Gives you a slight 30% increase in [[Dopamine]]. So on its own this is not that much of a Dopamine driver, but research shows that regular consumption of caffeine makes you able to experience dopamine effects better - so other dopamine hits will feel better. 

**Chocolate** - 1.5x increase of the baseline [[Dopamine]]. This is different from other sweets - they also give you an increase, but some components of the chocolate give you this real good boost. Sounds like a great excuse to get yourself a small-little Toblerone? Before you do that, don’t forget about the drop in Dopamine, hard of excessive carbohydrates and addictive characteristics of any dopamine-increasing substances. 

**[[Nicotine]]** - gives you up to 2x increase of Peak level of Dopamine, but the effects are very short lived. 

**[[Cocaine]]** - gives you 2.5x boost of Dopamine, making you feel freaking amazing for a short while, and then making you suffer, because you can’t find anything that gives you that good of a feeling.

**[[Amphetamine]]** - even worse than the one above - it gives you up to 10x boost of Dopamine, pushing the body to develop high levels of Tolerance to Dopamine in general, which means that it becomes harder and harder to feel pleasure from regular things. I mean how can you enjoy sex now, if only gives you 2x increase, compared to the 10x boost of this drug. 

**[[Aderol]], [[Ritanil]], [[Modafilin]]** - this is a family of [[ADHD]] drugs, prescribed for people with low levels of Dopamine in the brain, and they may give you up to 10x increase of Dopamine. They are very helpful for people with [[ADHD]], but they are not as good for others, because over time body develops tolerance, and you don’t enjoy activities you enjoyed with these drugs as much as before. 

**[[Macuna Pruriens]]** - a bean that contain lDOPA - a precursor to Dopamine. Increase of Dopamine depends on dosage, but as most of the drugs, it gives you a n increase of the peak level of Dopamine, which results in the drop afterwards. 

**[[L-Tyrosine]]** - amino-acid precursor to dopamine. Gives you a mid-term effect that lasts for 30-40 minutes, and then it will lead to the Crash in Dopamine. I use it myself from time to time, it helps a lot if I’m mentally exhausted after stress or sleepless nights. It gives me this feeling of focus. 

**PEA (Phenethylamine)** - increases levels of dopamine, the level depends on dosage. Also has 30-45 minutes lasting effect. It seems that it gives you a better regulated effect in the Dopamine increase, that produces a smaller crash than others.  

**Huperzine-A** - this is quite complex substance, that has multitude of different effect, potentially helpful in a number of conditions. In particular studies show that it increases levels of Dopamine and Norepinephrine in the brains. 

By no means this is a full list, but it gives you a general picture. There are plenty of substances that would give you a significant spike in Dopamine … just because you like them. This is more a psychological effect than purely biological one, created by the fact that your Dopamine circuit flows through the Pre-Frontal Cortex, where your preferences are analyzed and recorded. 

### [[Addiction]]s

It happened for a reason that Dopamine is often mentioned in the same sentence as addiction - mechanisms that regulate Dopamine cause the addictions, and its both - blessing and the curse. 

[[Addiction]] is an irresistible (and often harmful) behavior that you can’t control. It tends to ruin lives and makes us, humans, feel captive, without control over our lives. It is a horrible thing, yet it is just a natural product of the mechanism that makes us human. 

In the previous sections we talked about the Reward-Prediction Error. This is in the core of forming addictions. To remind you, it gives you a spike of dopamine when you receive an unexpected stimulation that brings you pleasure, and then associates the Cues of this stimulation to make you repeat it again. 

There are a few issues with this mechanism:

1. Using the same stimulus creates tolerance to it, so it requires more and more of this stimulus (more in volume or frequency) to get to the same level of pleasure. This is actually good, because for moderate amounts of stimulation (like food and sex) it makes us stop doing it so often - until the tolerance eases down and we can enjoy it again. But for for hard drugs. 
2. If this moderate stimulation is done often (causes frequent spikes of Dopamine) - it depletes the baseline of Dopamine. When Dopamine baseline is depleted - we are in psychological and sometimes physical pain. And the only way to resolve this pain becomes to find new spikes of Dopamine. And we often turn to the thing (substance of behavior) that generates the most of it for us. And then the cycle repeats itself. This part is crucial, because gradually any kind of addiction makes us repeat the behavior not because we WANT to do it now, but because we are in PAIN without this stimulus. This is how “I take it because it makes me feel good” turns into “I literally can’t function without it”.
3. If the dopamine is stimulated by highly stimulating drug - the baseline drops way below the baseline, and it takes too much time and effort to recover. Also, after experiencing this high level of Dopamine, brain develops tolerance to less potents stimulus, and everything else except for the drug becomes way less desirable. 

This process on its own can create addictions to things like food or sex - those that bring you moderate spike in Dopamine. 

**When you repeatedly do something your enjoy (what brings you Dopamine spikes) - threshold for enjoyment goes up and up, so it is harder and harder to experience the same level of pleasure. Gradually these spikes are lower, but “pain” spikes are created that makes us want to keep doing this thing. So instead of pleasure there’s pain that forces us to do things during the addiction.**  

Drug usage (cocaine, met) depletes one of the neural pathways for dopamine. Same pathway as for reward, motivation and craving. 

### Why is it a problem for society?

We moved from the world of scarcity to the world of abundance. 


### [[Uncertainty]] and Dopamine

How uncertainty drives dopamine spikes and gambling habits, and how it might be related to entrepreneurs who prefer to work in uncertainty.

Basically what entrepreneurs do is to live and work in uncertainty, hooked on it, enjoying it. 

### Socio-political impact

Liberals vs Conservatives

**What increases dopamine**

Baseline is defined by genetics and things that happened before in a matter of days.

In general if you like something the amount of dopamine for this behavior goes up. Especially if some gratification practice or journaling is done. 

This is where the addiction comes from - when the peaks are so high, and baseline is so low, that without and activity or a drug  it is impossible to motivate oneself. 

**Optimal ways to properly enjoy dopamine peaks**

Solution - Intermittent release of dopamine. Intermittent reward schedule. Intermittent reinforcement is the way to stay in the path to something. It is how gambling works when you get wins at slot machines at random times and it keeps you playing. 

The trick is not to celebrate every win, but to make some random breaks between celebrations. 

To keep doing what you like, you have to make sure the high peaks in dopamine do not occur too often. the breaks between peaks need to be random. 

**Remove Layering** - **Try removing multiple sources of dopamine release from activities which we want to enjoy or keep enjoying.** Layering several stimulants is bad because it brings higher peaks and the drops the baseline 

**Don’t spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort, and don’t spike dopamine after engaging in effort. Learn to spike dopamine from effort itself.**

[[Cocaine]]  or [[Amphetamine]] harm dopamine production for a long term. 

Healthy sustained increase in dopamine can be done by **Cold water exposure** - 5-6 Celsius. dopamine can increase 2.5x after that. In this case this is not a peak, but a sustained raise that takes 3 hours to go down. 14 Celsius in another study. 

**If you like something, and then start giving yourself a reward for this, and then take away the reward - you will stop liking the activity.** 

**Dopamine baseline will crash if you see bright light in the middle of the night.** 

**Since the dopamine pathway includes the [[PFC]]  - we can control what gives us the reward. We should not only get enjoyment from the final goal. We can learn to enjoy the effort, the hard work and process. Without layering in different sources of dopamine to make yourself continue. We are doing it by choice and because we love it.** 

The main trick is not to spike dopamine before or after an effort - only engage it at the effort. 

We can make ourselves feel pleasure from what we decide are good for us, because [[PFC]]  is connector to Dopamine pathways. 

**Research suggests that hearing something that confirms our beliefs invokes the spike in Dopamine. [[Confirmation Bias]]** 

Us vs Them confirmations also provide spike in dopamine. 

[[Dopamine]] is shaping what we see, perceive as reward. If it makes you feel good - dopamine will push you to keep doing it even if this is harmful for you. 

Social Connections also stimulate Dopamine. 

**How to make yourself enjoy the struggle instead of the goal.** 

When the dopamine is released it increases plasticity of the brain. This means that at the moments of high dopamine peak, pleasure, we can remember the struggle and appreciate it - it will teach the brain to enjoy it. 

another way is to give away the gold medal, or whatever was made during the struggle. 

I tend to get too much dopamine from telling about what I’m going to do and being certain that I can, that I don’t actually do that after that.

Laughing on oneself, being light is great. We enjoy being around people who are light, fully and make fun of us. We should do it to ourselves as well. 

Perfection should never be a goal. It is impossible and leads to depression. 


[[Serotonin]]  can be achieved through journaling, gratitude, meditation, social connections and mental rest - it recovers our system and gives us the balance.

When serotonin is low - people are agitated and aggressive. Irritable. 

When Serotonin is high - lower levels of aggression. When it’s really high - people stop pursuing goals at all. 

Explanations kill Glamour and limit dopamine release 

Postpartum drop - drop after the big excitement - 1-2 days after the event 

Intermittent reward schedules keep you motivated and pursuing. This is how uncertainty works. This is how [[Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]] works. 

Growth Mindset is when the idea of getting better, the feeling of striving to become better becomes a goal itself. This means that it teaches you to enjoy the effort to getting better, even thought it can be in the state of physical pain. This can be done through PFC. If you are only focused on the goal you have, you can not learn to enjoy the process, the struggle in the middle. If you only look at the long term goal - you are making it much more difficult to achieve something. 

What’s more beneficial - subjectively attach the feeling of friction and effort to the release of Dopamine. 

In the most painful moments, you need to tell yourself that you are doing by choice, because you love it, and that you will get a release of dopamine into the baseline later. Pleasure from Effort. It is accessible to all of us. 

What can prevent us from this - spiking Dopamine before or after engaging in effort - do it during the effort itself.
