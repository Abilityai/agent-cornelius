# LLM Data Privacy: 10-Minute Video Script
## "The Hidden Cost of Free AI: What Every Business Leader Must Know"

## [OPENING - 30 seconds]

**[SLIDE 1: The Two-Tier Reality - on screen]**

Let me start with a question that might save your company millions:

Do you know what happens to your data when you paste it into ChatGPT?

I spent weeks analyzing the privacy policies of every major AI provider, and what I discovered should fundamentally change how your organization uses AI.

Here's the shocking truth: The same AI company treats your data in two completely opposite ways, and the ONLY difference is whether you're using their free tool or their paid API.

This isn't about being paranoid. This is about understanding a fundamental business reality that most companies are completely missing.

## [THE SPLIT REALITY - 2 minutes]

**[Keep SLIDE 1 visible, point to diagram]**

Look at this diagram. This is the reality of AI data privacy today.

On the left, you have consumer services - your free ChatGPT account, Google's Gemini, Claude's free tier. When you use these, here's what's actually happening:

Your data is being used to train their next model. By default. That innovative product strategy you just asked ChatGPT to help refine? That's now part of their training data. Your proprietary code you asked it to debug? Training data. Your customer problem you wanted help solving? Training data.

Some providers let you opt out, but the process is buried, complicated, and sometimes geographically restricted. Meta, for example, only allows opt-outs in Europe where GDPR forces them to.

Now look at the right side - enterprise and API services. Same company, same AI model, COMPLETELY different treatment. Your data is contractually protected. It will NEVER be used for training. You can even get zero data retention - your information is processed and immediately deleted.

Same company. Same technology. Opposite data policies.

Why? Because privacy has been monetized. Protection is now a premium feature.

## [THE PROVIDER LANDSCAPE - 2.5 minutes]

**[SLIDE 2: The Provider Landscape - on screen]**

Let me break down each provider so you know exactly where you stand.

**OpenAI - ChatGPT:**
This is the most important date you need to know: March 1st, 2023. Before this date, even their API was training on your data. After massive pressure from enterprises - remember the Samsung incident where employees leaked source code? - they changed their policy. Now, if you use their API or enterprise tier, your data is safe. But consumer ChatGPT? Still trains on everything by default.

**Google:**
Here's something brilliant and terrifying. Google has one simple switch that changes everything: a billing account. The moment you attach a credit card to your Google Cloud account, even if you're using free credits, you're protected. No billing account? They're training on your data. It takes 30 seconds to add billing and completely change your privacy status.

**Anthropic - Claude:**
They're about to make a controversial change. Right now, they don't train on consumer data. But in late 2025, they're switching to opt-out. And here's the catch - if you opt out, you might lose access to features like memory and personalization. They're literally making you choose between privacy and functionality.

**Microsoft Azure:**
Microsoft took the opposite approach. They said: "We're already the enterprise cloud provider. Trust is our business model." Everything on Azure is protected. No consumer tier, no confusion. Your data is your data, period.

**Meta:**
Don't use Meta AI for anything business-related. Ever. They've admitted to training on public Facebook and Instagram posts going back to 2007. Third-party contractors have been caught viewing sensitive user conversations. Their ranking for privacy is dead last among all providers.

## [THE DECISION FRAMEWORK - 2 minutes]

**[SLIDE 3: The Decision Framework - on screen]**

So how do you navigate this? I've developed a simple three-tier framework that matches your data sensitivity to the right service level.

**Tier 1 - Critical Data:**
This is your customer PII, financial records, trade secrets, strategic plans.
Rule: ENTERPRISE ONLY.
You need contractual guarantees, zero data retention options, and third-party security certifications. No exceptions.

**Tier 2 - Confidential Business Data:**
Internal communications, draft documents, standard code, business processes.
Rule: PAID API MINIMUM.
The free tier is off-limits. You need at least the no-training guarantee that comes with paid services.

**Tier 3 - Public or Generic Information:**
Research on public information, general brainstorming, learning and experimentation.
Rule: CONSUMER OKAY, BUT...
Never, EVER input anything proprietary. Assume everything is training data. Have clear policies about what can and cannot go into these tools.

This isn't about avoiding AI. It's about using the RIGHT tier for the RIGHT data.

## [THE ACTION PLAN - 2 minutes]

**[SLIDE 4: The Action Checklist - on screen]**

Here's your 5-minute protection protocol. You can literally implement this today.

**First: Audit your current usage.**
Make a list. What AI tools is your team using? What data are they putting in? I guarantee you'll find someone using free ChatGPT for sensitive work. It happens in every organization.

**Second: Implement the quick wins.**
- Using ChatGPT? Switch to the API. It's actually cheaper for most use cases and your data is protected.
- Using Google? Add a billing account. Takes 30 seconds.
- Need maximum protection? Azure AI is your answer.
- Using Claude? Make sure it's the API, not the consumer version.

**Third: Ask providers four critical questions:**
1. "Is our data used for model training?" - If they hedge, run.
2. "Can we get zero data retention?" - For sensitive data, this matters.
3. "Do you have SOC2 Type 2 and ISO certifications?" - Trust but verify.
4. "Will you sign a DPA or BAA?" - If you're in regulated industries, this is non-negotiable.

**Fourth: Create clear policies.**
Your team needs simple rules:
- Business data never goes in consumer tools
- Sensitive data requires enterprise contracts
- When in doubt, use the higher tier

## [THE COMPETITIVE REALITY - 2 minutes]

**[SLIDE 5: The Bottom Line - on screen]**

Look at this matrix. Where does your company sit?

Most companies are in one of two danger zones:

The "Fast and Unsafe" quadrant - they're adopting AI quickly but using consumer tools for business data. They're one leak away from disaster.

Or the "Slow and Unsafe" quadrant - they're hesitant about AI, but when they do use it, they're using the wrong tools. Worst of both worlds.

Your competitors? The smart ones are in the "Fast and Safe" quadrant. They're moving quickly but using enterprise tiers. They get the competitive advantage without the risk.

Here's what I learned from my analysis: Speed still beats perfection, but speed without safety is corporate suicide.

The companies winning with AI aren't the ones with the biggest budgets or the best technical teams. They're the ones who understood this two-tier reality early and acted on it.

## [THE DEEPER IMPLICATIONS - 1 minute]

**[Stay on SLIDE 5]**

This isn't just about data privacy. This is about a fundamental shift in how technology companies monetize their services.

We've moved from "freemium" where you pay for features, to something more concerning - where you pay for basic privacy rights.

The EU is pushing back with GDPR and the AI Act. There are multiple lawsuits in progress. The regulatory landscape is shifting rapidly.

But you can't wait for regulations to protect you. You need to protect yourself now.

## [CLOSING - 30 seconds]

**[Return to SLIDE 1]**

Remember this image. Two tiers. Two completely different treatments of your data. Same company, opposite policies.

The choice is simple:

You can pretend this distinction doesn't exist and hope nothing bad happens.

Or you can spend the next hour implementing the protection protocol I've outlined and sleep soundly knowing your company's future isn't being fed into someone else's AI model.

The cost difference between consumer and enterprise? Negligible compared to one data leak, one leaked strategy, one compromised innovation.

Don't let free AI cost you everything.

Protect your data. Use the right tier. Move fast, but move smart.
