# LLM Privacy Video - Recording Hints
**Quick Reference for Key Talking Points**

---

## OPENING (30 sec)
• Question: "What happens to your data in ChatGPT?"
• Same AI company = TWO opposite data policies
• Only difference = free vs paid tier
• Privacy is now monetized

---

## THE SPLIT REALITY (2 min)

**Consumer Tier (Left):**
• Default: Trains on your data
• Product strategy → training data
• Code → training data
• Customer problems → training data
• Opt-out buried/complicated (Meta = EU only)

**Enterprise Tier (Right):**
• Contractual protection
• NEVER used for training
• Zero data retention available
• Same company, same tech, opposite policy

**Why?** Privacy = premium feature now

---

## PROVIDER LANDSCAPE (2.5 min)

**OpenAI:**
• Key date: March 1, 2023
• Before = API trained on data
• After = API safe (Samsung leak pressure)
• Consumer ChatGPT still trains

**Google:**
• One switch: billing account
• Billing = protected (even with free credits)
• No billing = training on data
• 30 seconds to fix

**Anthropic (Claude):**
• Now: No consumer training
• Late 2025: Switching to opt-out
• Catch: Opt-out = lose features
• Choose privacy OR functionality

**Microsoft Azure:**
• No consumer tier
• Everything protected
• Trust = their business model

**Meta:**
• Dead last privacy
• Trains on posts since 2007
• Contractor leaks
• Never use for business

---

## DECISION FRAMEWORK (2 min)

**Tier 1 - Critical Data:**
• PII, financial, trade secrets, strategy
• Rule: ENTERPRISE ONLY
• Need: Contracts, ZDR, certifications

**Tier 2 - Confidential:**
• Internal comms, drafts, code, processes
• Rule: PAID API MINIMUM
• No free tier

**Tier 3 - Public/Generic:**
• Research, brainstorming, learning
• Rule: Consumer OK BUT...
• Never input proprietary info
• Assume everything = training data

---

## ACTION PLAN (2 min)

**1. Audit:**
• List all AI tools
• What data goes where
• Find the free ChatGPT users

**2. Quick Wins:**
• ChatGPT → API (cheaper + protected)
• Google → Add billing (30 sec)
• Need max protection → Azure
• Claude → Use API not consumer

**3. Ask Providers:**
• "Used for training?"
• "Zero data retention?"
• "SOC2/ISO certs?"
• "Will you sign DPA/BAA?"

**4. Create Policies:**
• Business data ≠ consumer tools
• Sensitive data = enterprise contracts
• When in doubt = higher tier

---

## COMPETITIVE REALITY (2 min)

**The Matrix - 4 Quadrants:**

• Fast + Unsafe = One leak from disaster
• Slow + Unsafe = Worst of both worlds
• Fast + Safe = Winners (enterprise tier)
• Slow + Safe = Protected but falling behind

**Key Insight:**
Speed beats perfection, but speed without safety = corporate suicide

**Winners:** Understood two-tier reality early

---

## DEEPER IMPLICATIONS (1 min)

• Shift from freemium → paying for privacy rights
• EU pushing back (GDPR, AI Act)
• Multiple lawsuits
• Can't wait for regulations

---

## CLOSING (30 sec)

• Two tiers, two treatments, same company
• Simple choice:
  - Pretend distinction doesn't exist
  - OR implement protection now

• Cost: Negligible vs one leak
• Don't let free AI cost everything
• Move fast BUT move smart

---

## KEY NUMBERS TO REMEMBER:
• March 1, 2023 (OpenAI policy change)
• 30 seconds (Google billing setup)
• Late 2025 (Anthropic opt-out change)
• 2007 (Meta training data goes back)

---

## TONE REMINDERS:
✓ Urgent but not alarmist
✓ Competitive advantage focus (not just risk)
✓ Steady pace - let implications sink in
✓ Immediate, actionable, specific
