# Raw Notes - Consciousness, Free Will, Intelligence
*Captured: 2025-11-11*

## Reality and Expectations
Our perception of a reality is a network of expectations. The way we see it is the way we expect to see it.

## Mystery and Explanation
Once we explain something - this something loses a magic, it stops being interesting.

## Intentionality and the Unexplained
We tend to see anything that we can't explain or predict as having an intention, free will rather than chaos. God is seen as an intelligent creature with a purpose and is assigned to anything that is not explained yet. The more people can explain (predict) the fewer gods are responsible for.

## Mind as Intentionality
What if mind=intentionality? Meaning we perceive people as conscious because the mind is unpredictable, incalculable for us. The more we know about how brain works, what causes certain things - the more there's a talk that we don't have free will.

Because once you can explain and predict the mechanics of something - it can no longer be interpreted as a free will. If it can not be explained - then it can be interpreted this as free will and intentionality.

All of that means that we perceive people around as conscious because we can't explain how they make decisions. And we ascribe them free will and intentionality.

## Choosing Predictability (Russian)
Я выбираю путь в котором я могу больше всего предсказать. Когда решаю как идти, то есть совершаю любой выбор - я считаю рациональным выбирать то, где я вижу больше определенности.
Я просто делаю выбор в сторону более предсказуемых ситуаций, а другие могут по другому наверное. Это для меня такой путь рациональности.

Страх это когда мы в выборе дальнейших действий опираемся на оценивание ситуаций с точки зрения максимизиции определенности.

## Meta-Acceptance
it's okay to do what I do, whatever it is. It's okay to not think that this is okay. this is the trick.
I stopped thinking I'm not ok if I'm overthinking, or not overthinking, or feeling, or not feeling, or really anything and everything is OK. It's OK to not like something, it is OK to like it. It's OK to want to be like someone, and it's okay to hate to be someone. Once you know that this is all really really OK, then these problems and anxieties disappear, like there never were any of them.
I suffer when I question myself in the moment, instead of experiencing it, whatever IT is.
The problem is never what you think or feel of something. the problem is when you think that this feeling or thinking is a problem.

Fear and Shame are the reasons to feel you are not OK and then change the behavior.

## Expectation-Checking as Mind Driver
Checking expectations is the only driving function that makes minds be proactive.
Mind is organized in a way that our each move and each goal are because of the drive to check the expectation. Or prediction.
Each expectation becomes goal for checking in different degree.

## Order from Chaos
Universe is chaos, it is a chaotic random movements of something.
Sometimes, certain parts of this chaos spontaneously create islands of order. Only those kinds of orders that can survive longer will be staying longer. Many be even becoming irreducible. Self-sustaining order.
So the real question is how to create a self-sustaining order in a chaos.

## Multiple Intelligences
There will be more than one kind of intelligence, not just the AGI.
They will be specialized in different things.
All I'm doing now is running an experiment, a research, to find and build a kind of intelligence that will stand out.
In order to achieve it I run this project in a fashion that gives the goal, but still created experimentation and innovation.

## Goal-Dependent Memory
In human brain information is memorized more when this information is relevant to the goal of a person at this moment.
Selection of relevancy without a goal is impossible.

## Unique Perspectives and Absence
Perspective is shaped by the experience of a person. It has layers and layers of meanings, stories, archetypes.
LLM perspectives by impersonating them is not enough. They are not nuanced enough to provide value.
What create value in unique perspectives, is not what information agent knows (remembers, considers relevant), but what information it does not know (does not consider relevant). If an agent knows everything, they can not have a unique perspective by definition. Unique perspective is what drives creativity.

LLMs are "average". They know everything, but they are "average" as just helpful AI assistant. We can give them perspectives by defining the roles, but they are not nuanced enough. So absence of certain experiences, or Forgetting them is critical for unique perspectives.
