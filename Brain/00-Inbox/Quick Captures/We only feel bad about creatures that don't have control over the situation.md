If someone like a human with a healthy brain has control, so has a choice - we don't feel bad about them in the situation because we thing this is their fault and they could have avoided it. Which is not always the case at all. 

Control might be an illusion and they may not have a choice.

We should be kind and empathetic to everyone - animals and people.
