What do I want from it?
Things to think about??
	Why the company data becomes bad? Runtime Company
		tactical interest
		laziness
		no requirement
		no validation
		no feedback
		No step in the process
		No systems
		Unpaid (technical) debt

So far I don't like [[Zettelkasten]]. Several issues.
	 First of all I have too many thoughts and ideas, and there are too many of them in each book. So the question is - should make a note about each idea still or should I lose this information? How to decide which one is good enough? 
	 Knowledge about thinks is often bugger than one atomic thing.
