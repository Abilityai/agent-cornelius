If we look at the decisions as [[Bet]]s, we agree to a betting mechanics of payout. Which is as follows in case of betting against just one other player. 

> Payout = Bet + Bet * (1 - Estimated Probability)

So, if we bet $100 at something that we estimate as 30%, we should expect to get an outcome of:

$100 + $100 * (1 - 0.3) = $170

For multiple players in [[Zero-sum Game]], the formula would be:

> Payout = Bet + Bet * (1 - Estimated Probability) * (Number of Players - 1)

We can also thing about non-zero sum, but math becomes more complicated for this example. 

### Implied Probability 

There's another way to look at it - the Implied Probability formula, which is:

> Implied Probability = Stake / Payout

So, for the example when somebody tells you "I bet you $100 that team A is going to win", it only makes sense to take this bet if implied probability is less than estimated one. Meaning when you believe that the event is more probable than the bet suggests. 
This way, if your estimate is right you will be gaining more than just returning your money on average.
