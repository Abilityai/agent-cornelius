**Full Title:** The Science of Scaling: Grow Your Business Bigger and Faster Than You Think Possible

---

## Overview

Organizational psychologist Dr. Benjamin Hardy and Blake Erickson (co-founders of Scaling.com) reveal a framework that helps companies scale bigger and faster than they thought possible. The core thesis: you don't scale by adding more - you scale by removing everything that doesn't align with your impossible goal.

**Central Claim:** Companies applying this framework routinely grow 10-100x within just three years.

## The Core Framework: Frame, Floor, Focus

### 1. FRAME - Your Goal Defines What You See

**Definition:** In psychology, a "frame" is the way we see the world. The frame is based on goals - sometimes known, sometimes unknown.

**Key Insights:**
- Most entrepreneurs set goals too small, building systems that are too complex
- Small goals reinforce clutter instead of guiding clarity
- An impossible goal simplifies everything - it becomes a filter for what matters
- You stop trying to do everything and start doing the one thing that moves the needle

**The Psychology:**
- If someone has a goal of retiring at 65, that goal shapes their frame, their path, what they see and don't see, what they do for the next 30 years
- A bold frame narrows options to only viable paths
- A small frame leaves everything seeming possible (which creates paralysis)

**Application:**
- Set a goal so big it would astound your ancestors
- Compress time: thinking 3 months? Try 30 days instead
- Your 10-year goal? How could you do it in 3 years or less?

**Example:** College tennis offers hundreds of pathways; professional tennis offers one or two. Higher goals create fewer accessible paths, forcing elimination of lower-quality options.

### 2. FLOOR - What You Eliminate

**Definition:** The dividing line between good and great. Your standard - what you refuse to accept.

**Key Insights:**
- Raising your floor is the crux of scaling and upward mobility
- It means saying "no" to what you formerly said "yes" to
- It means saying "no" to even what most outliers would say "yes" to
- Anything "below the floor" is stuff you're saying "yes" to that shouldn't exist

**The Psychology:**
- Walking away from your past self means eliminating:
  - Good-but-not-great business aspects
  - Lesser goals inherited from previous identity
  - Relationships or opportunities misaligned with bigger vision
  - Comfortable but limiting patterns

**Application:**
- Whether it's low-leverage activities, distracting opportunities, or clients that don't align - you can't scale what's not focused
- Set super high standards for attainment
- Say no to the 99% of other things and lesser goals

**Quote:** "The floor is the dividing line between winners and losers. The higher the goal, the higher your floor must be."

**Case Study:** One company moved from $2M to $20M after raising their team standards.

### 3. FOCUS - Strategic Concentration Through Subtraction

**Definition:** Channel attention toward the few activities that have massive upside. Build systems, teams, and partnerships that scale without your constant involvement.

**Key Insights:**
- Growth comes from subtraction, not addition
- Saying no sooner, letting go faster
- More variables create randomness; fewer variables enable prediction and control

**The Poker Analogy:**
- Amateurs play too many hands and get stuck in losing bets
- Pros fold quickly, saving their energy for the right hands
- Focus means cutting the noise and concentrating energy where it matters most

**Application:**
- Build systems for your future self's behavior
- Hire for where you're going, not current state
- Identify work only you can do at highest value (Zone of Genius)
- Everything else becomes an elimination candidate

**Quote (Steve Jobs):** "Innovation is saying no to a thousand things."

### Why the Order Matters: Frame → Floor → Focus

Most people want to go from Frame straight to Focus ("here's the goal, how do I get there?"). But:

- Simplicity is a higher order concept than complexity
- Subtraction is a higher order concept than addition
- You must eliminate before you can properly focus

---

## Supporting Principles

### Identity-First Transformation

- Your current identity produces your current results
- Upgrade identity before upgrading systems
- Act from your future self, not present limitations
- Identity can root in your past (default) or future
- A bigger, more urgent future forces harder filtering of present activities

### The 10x vs 2x Principle

**Quote:** "10x is easier than 2x because 10x forces focus"

- 10x requires elimination of 80% to find the exponential 20%
- 10x forces clarity through constraint
- A 10x goal in compressed timeframe reveals:
  - Essential revenue drivers and conversion math
  - Unnecessary activities to eliminate
  - Required partnerships or resources
  - What truly matters strategically

### Time Compression

- Reframe time as distance, not duration
- Compress timelines through bold decisions and focused energy
- Progress stems from decision quality and learning velocity, not clock hours

### Transformation Over Addition

- Scale through becoming more, not doing more
- Build systems for your future self's behavior
- Hire for where you're going, not current state

### Growing vs Scaling (Key Distinction)

- **Growing:** Incremental increases ($2M to $3M)
- **Scaling:** Exponential transformation requiring identity shifts and business model changes

## Five Core Scaling Moves

| Move | Core Concept |
|------|-------------|
| Identity Upgrade | Operate from Future Self |
| 80% Elimination | Focus only on 10x levers |
| Time Compression | Shrink learning/execution cycles |
| Scale via Transformation | Multiply impact through aligned people |
| Impossible Goals | Use clarity as strategic filter |

## Key Mental Models

### Future Self Framework
- Make decisions aligned with 10x version of yourself
- Filter opportunities: "Does this serve my future?"
- Creates backward-planning from desired outcome

### Zone of Genius
- Identify work only you can do at highest value
- Everything else becomes elimination candidate
- Frees capacity for exponential opportunities

### Clarity as Filter
- Impossible goals kill noise
- Bold outcomes reshape present priorities
- Enables confident "no" to good opportunities

---

## Actionable Practices

1. **Define 10x outcome** with specific, measurable results
2. **Cut ruthlessly** - eliminate good to pursue great
3. **Set impossible deadlines** to force creative focus
4. **Reverse-engineer** systems from future identity
5. **Hire aligned with vision**, not present needs
6. **Audit current activities** against the goal - what falls below the new floor?
7. **Accept the discomfort** of disappointing others or leaving past success behind
8. **Distinguish between "looking good" and "becoming great"**

## Notable Quotes

> "You don't scale a business. You scale a person."

> "We are kept from our goal, not by obstacles, but by a clear path to a lesser goal." - Robert Brault

> "You don't change things by fighting existing reality. Build a new model that makes the old obsolete." - Buckminster Fuller

> "The system is designed to defend the system."

> "Good strategy is always unexpected, always."

> "If they broke, that's the time to fix it." - Richard Koch

> "The first benefit of a properly set goal is that it eliminates almost all options. Subtraction is a higher principle than addition."

## Case Studies

### Mark Young (Jekyll & Hyde Advertising)
- Generated $50M in new pipeline in just 6 weeks
- After 30 years of building to $20M
- Applied Frame-Floor-Focus framework

### Alicia Ault (LevelUp Score)
- Scaled from 10 clients to 8,000 in 12 months
- Method: Eliminated 90% of offers
- Focused on a single scalable pathway

## Philosophical Foundation

Hardy references Viktor Frankl's concept that meaningful growth comes from striving toward a worthy, freely chosen goal - not from tension-free states.
