## Summary
[[In Buddhism - Duhkha is the reason for all the suffering]]

[[In Buddhism - desire to achieve or get rid of something creates Duhkha]]

[[Thinking in Concepts are Categories can not fully describe the world and create Duhkha]]

[[Awakening and Enlightenment are about being in the Moment, in Here and Now]]

[[Buddhism might describe neurobiological mental states of Dopamine and Here and Now]]

[[Explanation is the way to categorize the world and it creates Duhkha]]

[[In Buddhism each attempt to Explain Reality removes the ability to directly experience it]]

[[Mortality is what gives things and beings real value]]

[[Desire creates a need to exert Control, and our inability to have full control creates Duhkha]]

[[In culture - more Choice is more Freedom, but it only creates more suffering]]

[[Enlightenment and Awakening are not when we stop wanting, but when we see the desires]]

[[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]]

[[People perceive Self as a static notion within us, separate from the outside world]]

[[Buddhism teaches achieving Selflessness to get rid of the illusion of Self]]

[[Buddhism teaches that Everything is in the constant state of change, flux]]

[[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty, to explain parts of the world that we can't explain]]

[[Once we hold a Belief, we will face people who have opposite beliefs]]

- Conceptualization, neatly packaging something give us an illusion that we know something. 

- In [[Buddhism]] you need to be comfortable with not knowing, with [[Uncertainty]]

[[Once we take a view (perspective, position, belief) we leave something out]]

[[Buddhism teaches to avoid fixing to any identity]]

- We can't approach [[Meditation]] as means to something. Meditation is nothing other than the intention to wake up. 

[[Categorization creates artificial duality]]

[[Any Rule or Dogma is opening doors for Relativism, Polarization and Conflict]]

- **We think of Freedom as an ability to Chose. But [[Choice]] is only possible in the world of concepts and categories, which is a bounded world, with specific boundaries. And this is not freedom. True freedom does not lie in having choices. We always have no choice but to act. Even if we chose not to act - this is still acting and making a choice** 

**Our mental states shape how we see the world. There's no real distinction between us and that's going on outside. If it is a grey day inside - it is a grey day outside.** 

[[Fear of death is based on the illusion of Self]]

[[Desire to find Meaning creates a meaningless world]]

[[Conceptualization of the experience (Reality) is creating this Illusion of Self]]

[[In Buddhism it is OK to conceptualize as long as we are mindful about it]]

[[Beliefs about the world create Doubt]]

-----

Our suffering comes from the confused state of mind, from the constant urge to get something or get rid of something.

Achieving the [[Enlightenment]] is simply seeing the world as it is, without concepts created by our [[Mind]]. It is [[Awareness]]

[[Enlightenment]] is about seeing things as they are right at this moment, without projecting to the future. It is about Here and Now [[HnN]]. 

[[Buddhism]] is about testing everything and every idea, not relying on concepts and analytical thinking too much. 

It is impossible to achieve Truth ([[Enlightenment]]) by giving up your authority and following others. This will only bring you to an opinion - yours or someone else's. 

[[Truth]] can not be defined with words, once can only see and experience it. 

[[Language]] can only describe world in [[Concept]]s that are limited in the description of the world. 

This thinking in concepts, splitting things into categories, explanations only creates [[anxiety]] and [[Suffering]]. 

Truth does not need [[Explanation]], it only needs to be seen. 

	[[The deepest meaning comes from suffering]] - might be related because it is about here and now. 

Truths of [[Buddhism]]
1. Truth 1 - There's [[Duhkha]]. It is typical for a human to suffer from dissatisfaction. Humans are unhappy by default. 
2. Truth 2 - Duhkha arises from thirst. Dissatisfaction arises within us - it is not coming from external sources
3. Truth 3 - We can realise the origins of this dissatisfaction
4. [[Nirvana]] or [[Enlightenment]] - means by which get rid of this dissatisfaction. We need to See

[[Awakening]] is about being fully present in Here and Now [[HnN]]
To do that we need to:
1. Realize that the life is fleeting. 
2. We are whole, we are enough, worthy, complete
3. We are our own salvation and sanctuary 

The fact that something dies, fades, stop existing is what gives this something a value. This is what we want - a living thing that dies. Everything is fleeting. 

You are (I am) the final authority. Not any external teaching or organisation. 

To come to [[Enlightenment]] we need to realize that there's really nothing "out there" for us to get, because at the present moment we are whole and complete. We just need to see it. 

We must live consciously, with [[Awareness]], not for the sake of anyone or any goal, but for being fully engaged in the moment. 

This can be achieved through the [[Eightfold Path]].

## First Truth  - There's [[Duhkha]]
[[Duhkha]] - the state of [[Mind]] characterised by leaning, suffering, satisfaction and constant chaise to get something or get rid of something. It seems to me like it's about these constant [[Dopamine]] cycles that make us uncomfortable, so we were motivated to fix this discomfort and return to normal state again. Or seek for momentarily pleasure. 

[[Belief]] is an approximation of the reality, at best - educated conjecture about it. 
[[Seeing]] is a raw, direct experience, direct perception of the reality. 

**[[Belief]] is a way to deal with [[Uncertainty]]. Parts of the world are always uncertain, there are things we don't know or can't know. And [[Belief]] is a system that creates a way to understand uncertain parts of the world. We need to to be able to explain and describe the world.** 

When you See the reality as it is, there's not need for [[Belief]]. 

There are different kinds of [[Duhkha]]
	Duhkha of Pain. Both physical and mental. We can only deal with pain by facing it directly. 
	Duhkha of Change. Everything around us changes all the time and it gives us discomfort. 
	Duhkha of Being. Existential pain. Realization we are going to die. Uncertainty about what happens after death. 
	
## Second Truth - Duhkha arises from thirst
Craving, wanting, trying to get something we want created [[Duhkha]]

There are different kinds of wanting:
1. Sensual - all the stuff we want to get pleasure directly
2. Existential - we don't want to die
3. Desire of non-existence - we want to be released from this world and stop the pain once and for all

Name what afflicts you, disturbs you, and you will immediately find it is associated with a desire or craving of some kind. 

We try to deal with all the problems by doing something about them - going through the door. But the reality is that all these problems are within and and we can't fix them by doing something outside. 

**When we want something, e.g. pizza, we don't just notice that we want it, but we want to stop wanting pizza, which creates more craving itself**

[[Desire]] creates a need to exert [[Control]], and our inability to have full control creates suffering and [[Duhkha]]. 

We define something we want or don't want as something outside of us, something separate from us.

**Our culture teaches us that maximisation of [[Choice]] is [[Freedom]].  The more choice we have the more free we are. But whenever there's a choice - suffering arises. More choices make us less happy and less free. It is a form of bondage. [[Paradox of Choice]]**

We feel more [[Duhkha]] about actions and things if there's an [[Intention]] behind them. For example, if you know someone broke your window intentionally - this feels much more disturbing than if this happened by accident - tree branch of something. 

[[Enlightenment]] is not when you stop wanting, it is when you See the desire. 

## Third Truth - There's an end to suffering
We experience everything in motion, everything moves and constantly changes. Our bodies are re-made moment by moment. 
[[Enlightenment]] is seeing this fact. 

You can't find coming into being as a separate event, things don't have a clear beginning or end. Only our ability to categorise things makes a distinction between beginning and end. 
Both the beginning and the end are inconceivable. 

[[Self]] is an [[illusion]]. We perceive it as a static, separate notion within us. 
To achieve [[Selflessness]] is to remember that we don't exist alone, but only in relation to other people, creatures and the universe. We are one with the universe. 

## Fourth Truth - Eightfold Path
The eight aspects of the [[Eightfold Path]] are:
1. Right view
2. Right intention
3. Right speech
4. Right action
5. Right Livelihood
6. Right Effort
7. Right Mindfulness
8. Right Meditation

Right should not imply [[Duality]] - something being wrong. Just think about it as "the way that works".

### Right View
Is not to hold on to a particular fixed view of the reality, fixed [[Belief]] or opinion. Everything is changing. There are no categories. 
Once we hold a [[Belief]], we will find people who have opposite beliefs and they will split into different groups and go after each other [[Us vs Them]]. 

We don't pay attention to what we actually know, and instead pay attention to what we think or believe. [[First-Principles Thinking]]. 

A set of beliefs usually is not more than a way to freeze the world in our minds. 
Right view is a constant motion. 

Conceptualization, neatly packaging something give us an illusion that we know something. 
Expectations built based on concepts are usually incorrect, because the categories don't fully represent the complexity of the world. 

Not knowing create anxiety, and this is one of the issues. **We need to be comfortable with not knowing, with [[Uncertainty]].** 

We handle uncertainty through the set of beliefs about the world. The closer we are to the real picture of the world the more we consider this picture a "knowledge", but even this is not real knowledge, it is a set of concepts and beliefs.   So in this logic - concepts (or categories) are beliefs. It is basically the same thing, the only difference is the level of Certainty. 

Once we take a view (decide on our position, perspective about something) - we leave something out. It is impossible to take a view, a belief and not leave something out. We can only keep one perspective, one view in our mind. That's why we hold on to our beliefs with a [[Confirmation Bias]].

[[Self]]
We think we actually are something. We are something stable, something fixed in time. "I'm this, I'm that...". This is due to attachment to a particular [[Identity]]. 
**When we fix our [[identity]], we become easy to offend. And we lock ourselves to very rigid ways of reacting and thinking**

Reality does not need to be explained. We can't comprehend reality with our intellects. If you can think of how reality is - this is really how it is not. Reality does not fit into concepts. 

In the Right View the Self does not exist. It is an illusion. 

### Right Intention
It is basically a desire, a perseverance to fight to find the Truth. 

There's no [[Intention]] when you are awake, or rather the only intention is to be awake. 
The Right Intention is simply an intention to come back to the current moment. Just becoming here and now is enough. 

We can't approach [[Meditation]] as means to something. Meditation is nothing other than the intention to wake up. 

Right intention is almost like no intention at all. 

All we want is for our mind not to lean anywhere. But we can't make it happen by trying to do so. We can only switch to be in the moment. 

### Right Speech
This is about [[Truth]] and transparency, about not lying. 
Not because it's bad, but because Lying created [[Duhkha]]

This is also about being kind and loving to other people and creatures. [[Love]]

Right speech also includes Right listening ([[Active listening]]) - observing things as they are rather than accepting some Story.  [[Narrative Fallacy]]

### Right Action
Acting from the clear mind, from [[Enlightenment]]
Right action is a [[Selflessness]] action, done without a sense of [[Self]]. Action where you don't see yourself as separate from the other parts of the universe. 

### Right Livelihood 
Live without doing harm to ourselves, others or the planet. 

### Right Effort
Constant and ongoing engagement with each moment. 
This means simply being present. 

Right effort is to not see the world in the fragmented way, where it is out there, and we are here, and it is categorized into concepts with one things agains another. Creating fake duality. [[Binary bias]]. 
**In this state we see that things outside us need to be manipulated or controlled. [[Control]]**

### Right Mindfulness
Right [[Mindfulness]] is not forgetting what the real problem is - [[Duhkha]]

[[Mindfulness]] of the body is the awareness of how it moves. 

### Right Meditation

## The way to wake up
The path to freeing the mind does not have beginning or end. It is not a path to somewhere. 

## Morality
Any rule, any [[dogma]] is opening doors for relativism, [[Polarization]] and [[Conflict]].

Trying to speak about the Truth and Reality is impossible - they can't not be represented with [[Language]]. We can only see the reality. 

**We think of Freedom as an ability to Chose. But [[Choice]] is only possible in the world of concepts and categories, which is a bounded world, with specific boundaries. And this is not freedom.
True freedom does not lie in having choices. We always have no choice by to act. Even if we chose not to act - this is still acting and making a choice** 

Not lying or not stealing are not dogmatic rules in [[Buddhism]], but awaken people don't do those thinks because they see that they lead to [[Duhkha]].

**Our mental states shapes how we see the world. There's no real distinction between us and that's going on outside. If it is a grey day inside - it is a grey day outside.** 

If we pay attention to a boundary between self and others, and closely observe it, we will see how it dissolves. We will see that the boundary was never there. There's no boundary between inside and outside. 

Our concepts is not reality. All of our beliefs, opinions, concepts are sitting on a huge uncertainty. And they create doubt. There's a profound doubt underneath all of our ideas.
True knowledge appears before all of our ideas and opinions. 

**The fear of death and everything that goes with it are based on the illusion of [[Self]]. Entering Selfless state removes the fear of death.** 

We create a meaningless world by trying to find and assign meaning to things. Our own desire to find [[Meaning]] creates meaningless world. 

Inherent Good and Evil are both frozen notions, concepts. They don't refer to any particular experience. It is another example of duality. 

[[To answer subjective questions you need to agree on definition of every word there]]

It is impossible for anything to remain itself and change at the same time. There's nothing in the universe that is not in the constant state of change, flux. 

By holding to [[Self]] we live in defiance of Reality. Self does not let us See the real world. And no seeing Reality is what makes us suffer, it is what hurts. 

**Reality needs not [[Explanation]]. Each attempt of the [[Explanation]] removes the ability to directly experience Reality.** 

People believe that [[Self]] is something that does not change. Which is not the case at all. 

There's experience, but no experiencer. There's perception, but not perceiver. There's consciousness, but no [[Self]] that can be located or identified. 

[[My Thought]] - [[Dopamine]] might create a feeling of a separate [[Self]]. 
Conceptualization of the experience is creating this [[Illusion of Self]]. 

Existence and non-enxistence are another example of [[Duality]], and they are also an illusion created by our [[Mind]]. They don't represent reality. 

Our belief of non-existence only arises as a result of our belief in existence. 
Only when we believe in the concept of Existence, we run into the duality of eternalism and nihilism. 

We all perceive things. The issue is not in perception, but in building concepts (beliefs, ideas, notions, habits) on top of it in an attempt to explain the world. 

**It is however possible and OK in Buddhism to conceptualize. When Buddhas are doing they they realize whatever they are doing and are not taken by it. Concepts themselves are not a problem, but thinking that concepts are the Reality is the problem. [[The map is not the territory]]**

Doubt is a flipside of belief. As soon as we have a belief - doubt arises. 
The moment we have a solid idea about Reality (belief) - we inevitably give rise to anxiety and fear. Instead we should only see, perceive Reality as it is. 

There's Absolute Truth and Relative Truth. Absolute Truth is a direct perception. Relative Truth are opinions and beliefs. 

[[Duality]] - whenever we come up with any concept at all, we simultaneously create the opposite concept. If we take opposing concepts as Reality - they will cause misery. 

Dependent Arising - a phenomena that Buddha created that says that When something arises, something else becomes. Basically a dependency and causality of the different things in the world. Might be related to [[Causal Thinking]]

Our problem has to do with [[Intention]]. We ignore the Whole are are taken by the parts. And we want to create concepts out of them. 
But the whole is impossible to describe with concepts, it is too detailed and represents [[Chaos]]. 

When the [[Mind]] is leaning we should not try to stop it. Trying to stop the leaning will create more leaning. Just be aware of it. 

We should base our actions on what we See, not what we think, conceptualize, theorize etc..
The only way to See is by noticing if your mind is leaning. To be awake. We just need to make Seeing our intention.
