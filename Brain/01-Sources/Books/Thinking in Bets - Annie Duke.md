Making decisions under [[Uncertainty]]

I poker - [[Resulting]] is equating decisions quality with the results. 

[[Resulting causes people to make safe decisions]]

If you think about your best and worst decisions - they will be associated and based on the best and worst results. Not decisions. 

[[Type 2 Error (false negative) is the most dangerous kind of error]]

[[Human brain looks for certainty and doesn't like uncertainty]]

Chess is a procedural activity where there’s always the best move to make even if you don’t know it. It’s very different in life, which is more like [[poker]] with [[Uncertainty]] around and [[luck]] playing the core role. 

[[Gambling and Betting companies are adjusting indexes to match the amount of money on each bet]]

[[Predictions and forecasts can't be wrong unless they are 0]]

Due to [[Loss Aversion]] [[Loss Aversion - losses feel 2x stronger than identical gains]] losses feel much worse than gains and that’s why people prefer feeling as winners when everything matches. 

[[Every decision is a Bet. No decision is a bet on Opportunity cost]]

[[Most Real-life Bets are against the future versions of ourselves that we are not choosing]]

Our [[Bet]]s are only as good as our believes. 

And out Believes are bad, the way we form out believes was shaped by evolutionary push towards efficiency, not accuracy. 

Instead of updating our [[Belief]]s when we receive the new [[information]], we interpret the new data coming in to fit our existing believes. This is a [[Confirmation Bias]] and **[[Motivated Reasoning]].** 

Our Believes are basically [[Reference Frame]].

[[Smart people are worse in catching their biases]]

[[Data Interpretation is the point where people exercise Confirmation Bias]]

[[Skin In The Game forces us to review our believes and avoid Confirmation bias]]

[[Skin In The Game forces us to review our believes and avoid Confirmation bias]]

Also the [[Skin In The Game]] need to be real. Not something that you don’t consider important or valuable. This would not work. 

All the fact estimates should be percentage based and should be updated as new information arrives. World is not black and white, it is probabilistic. 

[[Self-service bias - people take credit for success and blame the failure on luck]]

[[Black and white thinking causes both Self-service bias and Motivated reasoning]]

What is clear is they basic factual drivers of [[happiness]] are responsible for only 8-15% of it. The rest comes from our relative position to others. Where we think we stand in comparison to others. 

**[[Habit]]s**

They consist of a [[cue]], [[routine]] and [[reward]]. 

[[To change the habit we need to change the routine but keep the cue and reward]]

[[Self-service bias can be treated as a habit and the routine can be changed to build a new habit]]

I need to change the feature by which I compare to others. And this will change the routine and habits around it. To do this you need to be in the group of people who have these measurement sticks. 

Thinking about decisions as [[bet]]s removes [[Self-service bias]]. 

[[Confirmatory Groups promote biases]]
[[Groups are built upon the shared beliefs and approaches to handle uncertainty]]

Exploratory collaboration in [[Productive Group]] is combining biases and encourages change of the [[belief]]s, improves [[Decision Making]]. 

[[Bet is a form of personal accountability that creates Skin in the Game]]

[[Once we take a view (perspective, position, belief) we leave something out]]

[[We can hold only one point of view (perspective) in our minds at a time]]

Don’t share the [[outcome]] when discussing the decision with a [[Productive Group]].
