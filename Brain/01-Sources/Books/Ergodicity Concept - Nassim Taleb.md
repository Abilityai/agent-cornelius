[[Nassim Taleb]] [[Game Theory]] [[Statistics]] [[Investing]] 

The [[Probability]] of success from the collection of people do not apply to one person.

[[Ergodicity - in system with fatal events Time and Ensemble probability work differently]]

[[In Ergodic system average outcome of the Group is the same as Individual over time]]

[[In Non-Ergodic system Individual outcome is not the same as Group outcome]]

[[One should not invest majority of funds into investment assets that can drop to zero in value]]

[[In Ergodic system you are playin Infinite game, and Finite one otherwise]]

There's an opinion that this phenomenon forces people to make irrational decisions. For examples, in [[Loss Aversion]] bias people are afraid to lose the same amount more than they are to gain it. The reason could be that they treat it as a [[Non-Ergodic System]] and thus justifiably scared they can lose the last means of survival. 

[[Investor can make themselves more Ergodic using Diversification]]

 There are two ways of thinking about diversification that I find helpful.
[[Barbell Investing Strategy allows Diversification and protects from going bankrupt]]

[[Kelly Criterion formula allows to come up with the optimal Bet size]]
