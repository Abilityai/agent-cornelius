How a Single Chemical in Your Brain Drives Love, Sex, and [[Creativity]]―and Will Determine the Fate of the Human Race

[[Dopamine]] is the source of [[Creativity]]  and [[Motivation]]  for anything. The source of the itch. 

## **Chapter 1 - Love**

Dopamine spikes are coming from the surprise, something new, some novelty - learning, new relationship, new note etc.. But over time novelty fades. 

1/20M cells product Dopamine, but they have too big impact on the brain. 

[[Dopamine]] is not a market of pleasure, but a reaction to the unexpected. But over time [[Novelty]] disappears. This excitement about the novelty is called [[Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]]. 

Even hope for the possibility of [[Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]] is enough for the Dopamine to swing into action. 

[[Novelty]] disappears when there’s no more [[Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]] - when relationships don’t bring any surprises or new things. 

Brain divides world into Para-personal (PPS) and Extra-personal spaces (EPS) - whatever is near (stretched hand, things we can control now) and whatever is far (beyond, whatever we can’t touch). Brain works in different ways in those spaces. 

Any interaction in Extra-personal space must occur in the future - distances linked to time. So, it will take time, planning and effort to get things that are outside of us. 

For PPS there’s a lot of chemicals that control our experience - Here-and-Now molecules ([[HnN]]). in EPS - the main chemical is Dopamine. 

[[HnN]] molecules are [[Serotonin]] , [[Oxytocin]] , [[Endorphin]]  (brain’s version of Morphine), [[Testosterone]] and [[Endocannabinoids]] (marihuana).

Love and other things need to shift from EPS to PPS, which means we need to be able to switch to different set of chemicals. 

[[Glamour]] - it is present when we see things that trigger our [[Dopamine]] imagination. It is this feeling of allure around an object of desire, that makes us see things differently, illogically. Most of these experiences don’t exist. 

**What we think we will like (Dopamine dreams) and what we will actually like are entirely different things.** 

[[Gambling]]. Slot machines bring most of the revenue to casinos, the are the most effective. The reason it works is because the win periods change randomly, they are unpredictable. 

**[[Dopamine]] is NOT a pleasure molecule, it is Anticipation molecule.** 

The objective in Love is to move it from Dopamine to HnN molecules - to enjoy here and now. 

**In most cases, high [[Dopamine]]  brain circuits activation suppresses the activity of [[HnN]] circuits and vice-versa. This means that we can either plan for the future and enjoy uncertainty and anticipation, or enjoy what we have. Not at the same time.** 

[[Oxytocin]]  and [[Vasopressin]]  suppress release of [[Testosterone]]. In a similar way, release of [[Testosterone]] suppresses [[Oxytocin]] and [[Vasopressin]]. This helps explain why men with high Testosterone are less likely to marry. Single men have more Testosterone than married ones. 

[[Testosterone]] drives sexual desire in both men and women. 

During [[Sex]] , [[Dopamine]] drives the initial arousal, but then switches to [[HnN]]  molecules, and orgasm is almost entirely HnN experience. HnN shut down Dopamine. For some high Dopamine people it is hard to turn off the thoughts and just experience the intimacy, so they have problems with erection and orgasm. 

Our Dopamine cravings can never be satisfied. Dopamine can only say “more”.

## Chapter 2 - Drugs

There’s a huge difference between wanting something and liking it. 

Wanting comes from the old part of the brain called [[Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA)]]. It is reach in Dopamine and one of 2 Dopamine producing regions. Cells that grow there have long dendrites that reach the [[Nucleus Accumben [[(NA)]]]]. This is called [[  Desire Circuit (  Mesolimbic [[Pathway)]]]]. When Wanting happens, neurons from VTA create a spike of Dopamine in NA, which creates the motivation. 

This circuit evolved to give us motivation to get food, sex and win competitions. It is activated by something attractive from the evolutionary or life-sustaining standpoint. It is activated no matter if you are hungry. The sensation is not a Wanting, but rather a reaction to something we encounter. 

Dopamine forces us to accumulate everything that can help us survive and mate, even if we don’t need it. It creates energy, desire and feel-good moment. 

**[[Dopamine]] creates a feeling that life is about to get better.** 

Thinking forward, imagining things is what it forces us to do. Many people are constantly lost in thinking about the future because of the constant search for the next Dopamine hit.  

[[HnN]] are allowing us to enjoy and experience things, not [[Dopamine]]. 

Three way to not have a buyers remorse:

1. Buy something that will give you a boost of HnN pleasure
2. Buy something that can trigger further expectations, e.g. a tool for achieving something else
3. Keep buying more and more to get more Dopamine

---

Large dopamine surges created by [[Drugs]]  make a drug the most important thing in the world. Nothing else matters. That becomes the only motivation.

[[Drugs]] artificially ignite the Dopamine system no mater what happens, so brain associates them with any internal state. As a result - brain associates ANY feeling or any state with a desire to use drugs. It triggers craving. 

**Cues for the habit or taking drugs can be - people, places and things. Cue produced a [[Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]]. The solution to addictions is to remove the Cues from the life.** 

**Speed of the [[Dopamine]] release is very important - the faster it is, the more addictive is the Drug. Smoking a drug gives a faster injection than snoring, and IV injection is faster than smoking. Edibles is the slowest one.** 

Drug use provides diminishing stimulation over time. What people get later is release from pain rather than pleasure. 

**When dopamine system is at rest it fires 2-3 times per second. When it is excited - it goes to 20-30 times per second. When expected reward fails to materialize the rate falls to 0, which feels terrible.** 

Wanting is different from liking. Liking uses [[HnN]] hormones. 

Since [[Marihuana]]  is impacting both Dopamine and HnN networks it creates strange effects when people enjoy mundane things (HnN, but at the same time, lost in thoughts and imaginary worlds (Dopamine). In some situations [[Marihuana]] is suppressing Dopamine, in which case people have no motivation to do anything. 

Impulsive behavior ocurres when too much value put on the immediate pleasure rather than long term plan. 

[[Nicotine]]  triggers the Dopamine release, but really does not do much more. Which is different from most of the other drugs that bring pleasure. It only relieves craving for itself. That’s all

Prescription drugs also stimulate Dopamine. [[LDopa]] experiment created impulse in people to make riskier decisions, but did not make them happier than the placebo group. 

Pornography creates similar addition as drugs. It also forces to escalate the level of port over time. It is the problem is because it’s easy to obtain. 

Video games can also be addictive. Through the mechanism of surprise and uncertainty, and because usually adolescence play games for the most parts, and their [[PFC]] is not fully developed, so they are more susceptible. In games 25% is the magic number in terms of a surprise level in the game, when you open a box with a reward. 

## Chapter 3 - Domination

The only circuit powerful enough to oppose Dopamine is Dopamine. 

There’s a [[Dopamine Control (Meso-cortical) [[Circuit]] Circuit]], which goes through [[PFC]]. It allows to control impulses of Dopamine. Guide it where we need it to go. It is a “parent at the wheel”.

It also allows to control the imagination, see into the future to control the consequences of our intended actions. 

**So Dopamine goes to both circuit simultaneously - [[  Desire Circuit (  Mesolimbic [[Pathway)]]]] and [[Dopamine Control (Meso-cortical) [[Circuit]] Circuit]] (Tenacity circuit). The first one creates the desire to get something, and the second one allows us to make a choice and plan for getting it.** 

Removing Dopamine diminishes the need to work and Tenacity. 

We need to believe we can success before we can success, this is a function of Dopamine. Since dopamine information is going through [[PFC]], if we don’t believe we can achieve it - there’s not going to be Dopamine push to this. [[Cocaine]]  increases Dopamine and together with it increases self-efficacy, [[Brain/Confidence]]  in one’s ability to do anything. 

In 60s, doctors were prescribing amphetamine to people to correct their mood. But there are side effects 

Dominance and [[Brain/Confidence]] makes other people follow the person who displays it. It allows to dominate. 

**Relationships formed with an objective to achieve a goal are based on [[Dopamine]]. The other person is an extension of you, an agent to achieve the goal. It is about domination.** 

**Affiliative relationships are driven by [[HnN]] and are build for the purpose of enjoying each other’s company as is.** 

Usually relationships include both components. 

Through the [[Dopamine Control (Meso-cortical) [[Circuit]] Circuit]] Dopamine drives the Domination of the environment. It does not matter how it gets it. Sometimes through submissive behavior. 

High-achievers, who work relentlessly toward the goal, have high Dopamine in [[Dopamine Control (Meso-cortical) [[Circuit]] Circuit]]. They move on from one thing to another. For them life is about the future, and for them this is never enough. 

[[ADHD]]  - lack of control, distracted easily, don’t keep track of time, can’t keep focus. Usually seen in children. Treatments - ritalin, amphetamine, both boost Dopamine. They are addictive. People with ADHD have high risk of addiction. Social connections is an issue for [[ADHD]]. Children are inclined to overeating and other forms of addiction. 

**[[Schizophrenia]] is a mental illness caused by excessive [[Dopamine]] in the [[  Desire Circuit (  Mesolimbic [[Pathway)]]]].** 

Resisting any kind of temptation (using [[Dopamine Control (Meso-cortical) [[Circuit]] Circuit]]) will weaken the future ability to resist. [[Willpower]] is a limited resource. [[Willpower]] can be trained. 

**People don’t believe what they are told, but they do believe what they tell. So the best way to convince someone is to have them tell you what you wanted to tell them. Have the prove your point.** 

Interesting connection about liberals and conservatives. Where liberals are mostly progressive (looking for future change) and conservatives are looking for things to stay the same. This is highly similar to high dopamine people vs low dopamine people. 

Academia is the temple of dopamine. And most of them are liberals. 

Ability to manipulate abstract notions is a characteristic of a dopamine driven brain. 

Liberals have higher IQ scores. 

**Most of the daily decisions can not be approached in a rational way - we either have too little information or way too much. [[Decision Making]]. Emotions play a key role in these decisions.** 

Conservatives are happier than liberals. 

This is not as clear. There are [[HnN]] people among liberals. And vice-versa.  

**On average, liberals tent to be more forward thinking, cerebral, creative, intelligent and dissatisfied.** 

**Conservatives tend to be more comfortable with emotions, reliable, stable, conventional, les intellectual and happy.** 

Amygdala and fear creates [[Loss Aversion]] 

People have specific genetic predispositions (7R allele)  toward being more novelty seeking and dopaminergic. 

Success of the US in innovation and entrepreneurship might be attributed to the fact that it is built on immigrants, and those who immigrate have higher chances to have generic inclination to be more dopaminergic. Similar thing happened in Canada, Israel and Australia, which also have a lot of immigrants. 

That left Europe with majority of people who are inclined to [[HnN]] lifestyle. More focused on “now”. 

**Social isolation, even without feeling lonely, predicts 50-90% chance of early death, which is higher than obesity and the same as smoking. We need social relationships to stay alive.** 

Dopaminergic people have to give up control. They don’t like to be in [[HnN]] state because it is uncontrollable. They only can control the future. But future is the world of phantoms. Nothing is true there, this is just imagination. 

Mastery, when we achieve a good level of expertise in something, is when Dopamine gives way to [[HnN]] to really feel happy and enjoy it. 

It also creates a feeling of Internal Locus of Control - feeling that you control things around. This is good for us, much better than external one. Flow comes from striving to Mastery, and requires higher and higher complexity of tasks. 

[[Dopamine]] excessively released when the reality is better than expectations - [[Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]]. But then for dopamine it means that it is not exploiting the situation to the fullest, and it will not let this same “surprise” happen again, we won’t feel good about the same thing. The only thing we can do to keep the surprises coming is going forward. 

People are less happy when their mains are wondering. No matter what they are doing at the same time. People are happier when they are paying attention. 

Creation is the most durable of the dopaminurgic pleasure. It mixes us Dopamine and [[HnN]]. Especially those activities not directed to the outer world, just the ones for you. Physical ones work much better, like building or fixing stuff.
