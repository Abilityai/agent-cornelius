# How to Take Smart Notes
He retells the approach of Luhmann - [[Zettelkasten]]

Basic flow
1. Fleeting notes - random notes, quotes, ideas, things come to mind, book notes. These notes are only useful if you review them and summarise into cohesive thoughts. 
2. Literature notes -  summary of your understanding of the fleeting notes - interpretations through my lens
3. Permanent Notes - single idea on one note! Linking ideas between different notes above. 
	1. Write exactly one note for each idea. 
	2. Write as if you are writing for someone else. 
	3. Use full sentences, sources, links
4. Add Permanent notes to slip-box
	1. Add links to related notes
	2. Putting in the right category
5. Develop research from bottom-up
6. After collecting enough information decide on the topic
7. Turn ideas into the draft
8. Edit


[[Atomicity]] is the main principle of the whole method. Each note contains one unit of knowledge and one only. 

In Permanent notes, put ideas out of context, so that it could be interpreted in other contexts.
