The book is about changing the mind and updating the beliefs we have. 

Knowledge is increasing and the pace at which it is increasing is also increasing. 

In 2011 you consume 5x [[information]] from what you would have consumed 25 years earlier. 

In 1950 medical knowledge was doubling every 50 years, By 2010 it is doubling every 3.5 years.

**Accelerating pace of change means we need to update our beliefs more readily than before.** 

We favor feeling right versus being right. 

It introduces a concept of 4 roles in our [[mind]]:
	**[[Preacher]]** - we go there when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy. We protect and promote our ideas. 
	**[[Prosecutor]]** - this is when we recognize flaws in other people’s reasoning. 
	**[[Politician]]** - seeking to win over the audience. 
	**[[Scientist]]** - it’s a frame of mind where you are searching for the truth. Strategy is a theory. Customer interview help to develop hypothesys. MVP - experiments to test those hypothesys. 
	Being in this mode means being activelly open-minded - actvely looking for the evidence that you are not right. 

Evidence reveals that the best strategist are slow and unsure. They take their time and have the flexibility to change the mind. 

The higher the IQ the stronger is the ability to recognize patterns and the higher is the likelihood to fall into stereotypes. People with higher intelligence have to update their views and values much more often than others.

Math people failed to analyze the data that contradicts their beliefs. If they were liberals they were worse in assessing evidence that guns are good, and vice-versa. This is driven by [[Decision Making/Confirmation Bias]] and [[Desirability Bias]].

His favorite bias are "I'm not biased" bias when people believe they are less biased than others. Smart people fall into that more often than others. The brighter you are the harder ti is to see your limirations. Being good at thinking might make you worse at re-thinking. 

If the knowledge is power - knowing what we don't know is wisdom. 

[[Scientific thinking]] favor humility over pride, doubt over certainty, [[curiosity]] over closure. 
[[Overconfidence effect]]

## Chaper 2
[[Decision Making/Imposter syndrome]]
Gives exampels of the people who are blind, but have no idea they are and don't want to admit it. They are blind to the fact that they are blind. 
We need to recognize cognitive blid spots 

The less intelligent we are in a particular domain - the more we tend to think we know about this domain. This is a [[Dunning-Kruger effect]]. The problem with that effect is that if we are certain we know something - we see no reason to learn and update our beliefs. 
[[Brain/Confidence|Confidence]] raises very quickly and makes people think they understand everyhing. 
[[Humility]] is a solution. We should take a regular dose of it. 
Total beginners don't fall victim to [[Dunning-Kruger effect]] effect. They are open to learn. 

[[Arrogance]] is ignorance plus conviction. Gain too much confidence and we switch to arogance. Lose too much confidence - and we become weak. 

[[Humility]] is not about having lack of confidence. It's about having the right tools. Confident humility can be taught. 

The pace of change of information is staggering and unparralell to the past, and that's why it is especially important to be able to change your mind quickly. 

Feeling [[Imposter syndrome]] feels like a bad thing, but more than 50% of people feel this, and this is especially pronounced among high achievers. Often this is WHY they are high achievers. People with [[Imposter syndrome]] are not any worse than others in doing the subject, but they were more empathetic and were more attentive to the subject. 
	It can motivate us to work harder. 
	It can make us better learners
We can thrive on the tools that [[Imposter syndrome]] gives us, on the doubts, on the lack of confidence. It is needed for change. Doubt is a good thing, especially if it comes from understanding how little you know.

[[Arrogance]] leaves us blind to our weaknesses, and [[Humility]] is a reflective lens that helps us see more clearly. 

## The joy of being wrong
The core skill from this chapter is to learn to be enjoy being wrong. 

Experiment in the 60s where the beliefs of the people were attacked directly.

Murray Davis argued that [[Idea]]s survive not because they are true, but because they are interesting. What makes an idea interesting is that they challange our weakly-held opinions. 

When the core [[Belief]] is questioned - we tend to shut down and not let it change at all. 
There's a miniture dictator that controls the flow of ideas into our mind. The term in psychology for this is [[Totalitarian Ego]]. It is like a bodyguard that protects our self-image and our core beliefs. We become preachers or prosecutors as protective mechanisms.

**When you are discovering you are wrong this means that now you are less wrong than you were before. Being wrong is the only way to feel sure that you learned anything.** 

**Being able to enjoy being wrong is possible when you detouch your present from your past and detouch your opinions from your [[Identity]].** 

[[Identity]] should be based on the core values, not on the inflicted beliefs and opinions. 

[[Decision Making/Forecasting]] skill is less a metter of what we learn than how we think. The biggest predictor of the good forecaster is how often they are updating their beliefs. 

### [[Motivational interviewing]]
A type of conversation in which we lead people to think about their ideas and problems through a series of questions. It’s based on the premise that we can rarely convince people to change, but we can help them find their own motivation to change through questions. Motivational interviewing involves 3 techniques:
1.  Asking open-ended questions
2.  Engaging in reflective listening
3.  Affirming the person’s desire and ability to change

Motivational interviews helps us avoid putting too much pressure on people to change. Sometimes people shut down to change because they feel that someone else is pressuring them or controlling their decision.

**Sustain vs. change talk**
-   Sustain talk: commentary about maintaining the status quo
-   Change talk: referencing the desire, ability, need, or commitment to making changes

Good motivational interviewers look for sustain and change talk. When they identify change talk, they may ask questions that help the person go further down that line of thinking.  
To be a good motivational interviewer, you must cultivate a genuine desire to help people reach their goals.

### Talking about complex issues
When it comes to discussing complex issues, we often fall victim [[Binary bias]], our tendency to seek clarity and closure by simplifying complex ideas and situations into two categories. By framing an issue as only having two sides, we force people to talk one side or the other, despite a continuum of complexity.

While this type of framing can help rile up people on your side, it does very little for helping other rethink an issue. We can do better by “complexifying,” which involves highlighting the range of perspectives on a given topic.

### Creating a culture of [[Learning]]
An organisation with a culture of learning requires at least two things – [[Psychological safety]] and [[Accountability]].

-   [[Psychological safety]] is about creating an environment of trust, respect, and openness where people can raise concerns and ideas without the fear of being reprimanded.
-   [[Accountability]] is about process accountability – ensuring that in the process of designing experiments or creating something, people have gone through a process that allows for a good chance of making the best decision. This cannot be based solely on outcomes or results, because outcomes are difficult to determine and sometimes the result of luck.

### The perils of [[Identity foreclosure]]

[[Identity foreclosure]] is when we settle prematurely on a sense of self without doing enough homework on the many options available. It leads us to close our minds to alternative selves and is commonly seen when people are choosing fields of study or careers.
We often base our choices based on past versions of ourselves, the expectations of others, and so on. When we get new data, if we’ve foreclosed on our [[identity]], we may not be willing to rethink the assumptions that led us to pursue a particular path. This is how we stay in unfulfilling jobs for 20 years, instead of 2 years.
[[Identity]] foreclosure is one of the leading forces that stops us from evolving in our personal lives, careers, and romantic relationships.

### Discovering [[Passion]]

You don’t think your way into your passions. Passions are often born in trying things, in action. The more you do, the more you learn about what fills your bucket. And this can lead you to new passions you may have never discovered otherwise if you close your mind and stop exploring.
It’s important to remember that there are multiple ways to get to some outcome, and there are also multiple starting places from which you can get to an outcome. Don’t close your mind to “one path.”

### The Art of Conflicting 

Since we can’t avoid [[Conflict]]s, we need to learn how to manage them. Adam Grants explains two types of conflicts:

1.  _Task conflicts_. [[Constructive Conflict]] They occur when members of a specific team decide who should tackle a problem, what should be done and how, etc. This type of [[Conflict]] is constructive because it prompts the seeking of creative solutions.
2.  _Relationship conflicts_. These occur between people. Often these conflicts are detrimental because they impact interpersonal relationships negatively. However, if the parties to an argument show respect for one another, they may end up with a higher degree of compassion and cooperation.

Our society tends to regard pliability, or a tendency to avoid conflicts, as a positive trait. The author disagrees with this perception. He believes that people who are not afraid to show disagreement with our opinions actually push us forward. They help us evaluate our abilities and find ways of improvement.
