[[Buddhism]] [[Awareness]] [[Enlightenment]] [[Duhkha]]

[[We only bare responsibility to those creatures who can have conscious experience of suffering]]

[[Distraction and constant thinking is a default state of our mind]]

Awareness of the present moment, among the constant flux of the reality. 

We are constantly jumping between wanting to have pleasant and running from unpleasant. 

[[Buddhism teaches to not identify with our thoughts]]

[[Both hemispheres of the brain are separately conscious]]

Notions of meaning morality and value presuppose the existence of concussions 

[[In Buddhism - Self is an Illusion]]

Self is an illusion. And it disappears through the meditation 

[[Psychological continuity matters much more than identity]]

[[Self is impossible to find, but possible to find its absence]]

[[Ego & Self is what it feels like to be thinking without knowing that you are thinking ]]

Reality is simply the loss of an ego. It can be destroyed by searching for it 

[[Theory of Mind could be one of the ways to lose self]]

[[Spirituality is a quest to recognize that Self is an illusion]]

The only thing that really matters for personal identity is a psychological continuity of the self. 

[[Brain is a reality filter]]

Thoughts are transient appearances in consciousness 

[[Thinking itself produces and inflates emotions that we suffer from]]

If you think where’s the anger, where it comes from and what is feeling it at this moment - you will get rid of it. 

The primary source of human suffering is inability to recognize thoughts as appearances in consciousness. Identifying them with ourself. 

[[Self is a feeling that is created by consciousness, by thoughts]]

[[Self is gradually shaped by other people and groups through Identity]]

We need to accept the present moment the way it is. 

[[Boredom is a lack of attention]]
