BS is an Unknown Unknown

Anti-library concept - the books you have not read in your library are more important than the ones you have. 

Mediocristan - a scenario where the sample is very large and one instance can not change the aggregate of total. Normal distribution can be used for these cases. Examples:
Professions like Dentist, doctor, consultant - one day will not make much difference for your income. 

Casino, where bets are not far from the average, which allows casino to control the output

[[Extremostan]] - inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate or the total. [[Normal Distribution]] can rarely be used for these cases. Examples:

[[Confirmation Bias]] - people tend to jump to conclusion and focus on evidence confirming those conclusions.

[[Narrative Fallacy]] - because of this effect people don’t see BS. The way to avoid it is to prefer experiments over storytelling, experience over history. 

[[Survivorship Bias]] (also called silent evidence) is highly impactful in [[Extremostan]]. People don’t remember about those who did not make it. And thus they become blind to BS

[[Overconfidence effect]]

[[Barbell Investing Strategy]] - avoiding medium-[[risk]] investments. Putting 90% into low risk ones and 10% into very high risk-high reward ones.
