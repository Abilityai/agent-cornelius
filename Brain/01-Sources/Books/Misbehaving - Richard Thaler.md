Review these models when you are working with a problem involving you or other people dealing with money. 

[[Risk Aversion]] - People are looking for a risk to help them avoid losses, but avoiding risk when looking for gains, except for the cases when they think they are “ahead in the game”. 

[[Diminishing Sensitivity applies to both gains and losses]]

[[People take a more risk when heavily ahead or behind]]

[[Loss Aversion - losses feel 2x stronger than identical gains]] 

[[Prospect Theory - loss and gain are assessed asymmetrically]]
	Suppose you drive a car for 300 miles. You can save time by speeding and it will save you some time. But only if you are speeding the whole way. When you are close to finish line - this won’t give you much savings. So would it make sense to stop speeding at some point? The answer in the book is No because the chance of getting a ticket is proportional to the drive time. 

**[[Mental Accounting - context defines if price feels like gain or loss]]** 
[[Price sensitivity is defined by the Context in Mental Accounting]]

Specific scenario can be re-setting a reference frame to a higher value and then initiating purchase. 

[[Mental Budgeting - people have mental buckets that they spend from]]

[[Mental Budget of Cash is much easier to spend]]

[[House Money Effect - people are more likely to take risks if they are ahed in the game]] 

[[New money, especially easily earned, must be internalised or will be lost]]

[[Money made on high-risk volatile markets are lost quickly and easily]]

## [[Sunk Cost Fallacy]]

[[Sunk Cost must be ignored or it will exploit you]]
[[Sunk Cost feeling tends to diminish over time]]
[[People take a more risk when heavily ahead or behind]]
[[Mental discounting - things here and now cost us more than later]]

[[Principal-Agent problem is caused by misaligned incentives]]

[[Myopic Loss Aversion - losses seem bigger when you check them frequently]] 

[[Optimal time to look at portfolio is once a year]]

[[Endowment Effect - what we own is more valuable than what we don't]]  

[[Endowment Effect puts us in a bad position for negotiation]]

[[Game theory has limited use since it relies on rational agents]]

[[Biases affect high stakes players because stakes are relative]]

“When your opportunity cost is low - it pays to take the risk and speak up”

“Create environment where data driven decision making is rewarded, not outcome based decision making”

[[Value of early picks is highly overestimated]]

Author thinks that the more important decisions are the more managers inclined to use their gut instincts instead of statistical reasoning. 

[[Present bias]] 

[[Present bias - what is happening now is more important than the future]]

**Fairness**

[[People don't think it is fare to raise prices during scarcity]]

[[Feeling of Price Fairness is related to Endowment effect - people think they own the price]]

Raising prices because cost have increased is almost always fare. 

Example -  a bank got a huge pushback when they started to charge $3 for using a bank teller instead of ATM, while it way always free. This was considered unfair. So if you want to change behavior from one to another you need to encourage new behavior instead of penalizing the old one. 

[[The Ultimatum Game]]

[[Feeling of fairness creates irrational behaviour in the Ultimatum Game]]

[[The Dictator Game]]
[[People have a clear willingness to punish unfair players at their cost]]

## Investing

[[EMH - Efficient Market Hypothesis]]
[[Efficient Market Hypothesis is a form of Wisdom of a crowd]]
[[Connectedness of the world makes Efficient Market Hypothesis obsolete]]

EMH assumes that market prices consider all the information available, so there’s no way to beat the market. But the more people have access to trading the less this theory works. So as more countries introduce easy to use applications to enable the access of the wider crowd to the market - the more emotional decision making will prevail. 

[[No free lunch]]

Seasonal businesses like ice companies have variations in prices during the season, although they should not, because the price should reflect long term earning expectations. 

**Beauty contest game** - guess a 2/3 of the average guess number from 0 to 100, from many different guesses. 

[[Value Investing]] - buying stocks that are cheap. Based on lower P/E ratio. This does not work in a period of bubbles. Data confirms that Value stocks are not riskier, though they are considered riskier by market. 

[[Growth Investing]] - buying stocks that will grow quickly. Based on higher P/E ratio. 

It is possible that both are just representing [[Regression to the Mean]]. 
mean reversion - Losers would outperform winners. if this is the case, this is a violation of the EMH. 

[[Market with rational agents requires much fewer trades than we see now]]

CAPM - Capital asset pricing model - the only risk that is rewarded in a rational world is a degree to which the stock is correlated with the rest of the market. If you take risky stocks and they are positively correlated - this is a much riskier portfolio than if they are not correlated - effects will cancel each other out. This the riskiness of the stock in this concept is how much the stock is correlated with the market. Beta is a measurement. Beta 0 - completely different uncorrelated. 

CAPM is considered dead by many people. 

Bubbles are much easier to predict that we are in them than to predict when they are going to burst. 

Housing market bubble was predicted by looking at the ratio of house selling prices and rent prices, which went up significantly. figure 13

**Close ended funds** trade the same stock but they may be priced differently than the stock they hold. This basically indicate 2 different prices for the same model. It is smart to buy them at a discount but not at the start with commissions. 

There are situations on the market when the same stock is priced differently. If this happens on the different markets - this is [[Price arbitrage]]. But this can also happen within one market. Finding this kind of situations is a great way to make money. 

In 90s, when 3M separated Palm from their stock it raised Palm stock, because palm looked cooler. 3M price went down. But the price of 3M became effectively negative. 

**If 2 stocks of related companies are on the market and they are different in price significantly like with 3M - short one and long another to make a bet that can not lose.** 

Review when purchase is considered an expense vs gain
