# The Culture Map by [[Erin Meyer]]
[[Business]] [[Leadership]] [[Management]]

## [[Key Insights]]
 - People from different [[Culture]]s are different on a number of scales. Cultures can be anywhere on the scale and it’s better to compare them to one another than to try to put them on numerical scale. 

### **Communicating - Level of Context**

**High Context** (Japan, China) - cultures with large historical background, as a closed system (e.g. limited by language or territory). Japan, Korean, France are high context cultures. 

In this kind of cultures the communication is subtle and not explicit, not direct, and you are expected to communicate this way as well. 

**Low Context** (US, Australia) - usually in the countries with shorter history and more immigrants, like the US. Communication is explicit to avoid misunderstanding. 

### **[[Feedback]] and [[Criticism]]**
It can be Direct (like in Russia) or Indirect (Japan)

### **Persuading**

Principles-First (Russia, Romania) - explaining the basis, principles first and then providing the outcomes, the result. 

Application-First (US, Japan) - providing the resulting conclusion, application, and only then explaining the principles.

### **[[Leadership]] Style**

**[[Egalitarian]]** (Sweden, Denmark, Israel) - all the participants of the group participate in discussions and decisions, express their opinions openly and contradict the boss. The ideal distance between a boss and a subordinate is low. The best boss is a facilitator among equals. Organisational structures are flat. Communication often skips hierarchical lines.

**[[Hierarchical]]** (Russia, Japan, China)  - Boss is making [[Decision]]s, and others listen. The ideal distance between a boss and a subordinate is high. The best boss is a strong director who leads from the front. Status is important. [[Company]] structures are multilayered and fixed. Communication follows set hierarchical lines.

### **Deciding Style.** 
[[Decision Making]] [[Decision]]
Consensual (Sweden, Japan) - Decisions are made in groups through unanimous agreement.
Top-Down (China, Russia) - Decisions are made by individuals (usually the boss).

### **[[Trust]]ing**
**Task-based, Cognitive trust** (US, Denmark) **-** [[Trust]] is built through [[business]]-related activities. Work relationships are built and dropped easily, based on the practicality of the situation. You do good work consistently, you are reliable, I enjoy working with you, I trust you.

**Relationship-based, Affective trust** (Russia, China, India, Brazil) - ****Trust is built through sharing meals, evening drinks, and visits at the coffee machine. Work relationships build up slowly over the long term. I’ve seen who you are at a deep level, I’ve shared personal time with you, I know others well who trust you, I trust you.

The more established the country is, the more reliable legal system is - the more people are trusting on task-basis. In the countries with less clear ground rules - relationship-based trust prevails. 

### **Disagreeing**
[[Conflict]]
**Confrontational** (Israel, Russia, Germany, France)- Disagreement and debate are positive for the team or organisation. Open confrontation is appropriate and will not negatively impact the relationship.
**Avoid Confrontation** (Japan, Thailand, India)- Disagreement and debate are negative for the team or organisation. Open confrontation is inappropriate and will break group harmony or negatively impact the relationship.

### **[[Scheduling]] - Perception of Time and Tasks**

Linear (Germany, Japan, US, Swiss) - complete one task before starting the next one. They prefer schedules, calendars, completion by a certain time. Project steps are approached in a sequential fashion, completing one task before beginning the next. One thing at a time. No interruptions. The focus is on the deadline and sticking to the schedule. Emphasis is on promptness and good organisation over flexibility.

Flexible (e.g. Saudi Arabia, Turkey, India) - Project steps are approached in a fluid manner, changing tasks as opportunities arise. Many things are dealt with at once and interruptions accepted. The focus is on adaptability, and flexibility is valued over organisation.
