This books is about [[Dopamine]] 

[[Human brain evolved to function in the world of scarcity, and now we live in abundance]]

[[Pleasure]] and [[Pain]] are processed in the same part in the brain. 

The main idea is that mediates people’s behavior is a balance of the pleasure and pain. Too much pleasure leads to pain. A bit of pain leads to pleasure. This is all regulated by Dopamine. 

[[Dopamine is responsible for Motivation to do anything]]

[[Dopamine]] dictates the drive to get anything. Genetically modified mice will starve to death inches from food if they did not have Dopamine. But they will eat it if food is put in the month. 

Dopamine measures how addictive something is. The more dopamine is released, and the faster it is released - the more addictive is the drug. 

[[Pleasure and Pain strive towards balancing each other in the brain]]

[[Once Pleasure-Pain balance is leveled - brain keeps going inertially to the opposite side]]

Craving comes after pleasure - Another piece of pizza, or another movie. 

[[With repeated exposure to same stimulus Dopamine spikes weaken]]

[[With a lot of pleasure default balance shifts to pain and suffering]]

[[High-dopamine substances abuse can result in Anhedonia]]

Abstinence syndromes for any of the drugs are the same - [[Anxiety]], Irritability, [[Insomnia]] and Dysforia. If we wait long enough in most cases we can re-establish the baseline and enjoy regular daily things. 

Cue-Dependent [[learning]], or Pavlovian conditioning

This is also described as reward prediction error [[Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]]

Anticipated reward that did not materialize is worse than the unexpected small reward

[[Dopamine spikes reinforce previous actions and create Learning]]

[[Uncertainty in itself is rewarding can create Dopamine spikes]]

[[Uncertain Cue gives a higher Dopamine reward than certain one]]

This might have an interesting angle on management - all you can do to motivate people is to create Craving, so dopamine drop after the expected pleasure. So you need to promise a ton, to get people motivated. But if you are not delivering on your promises - their level of Dopamine drops well below the baseline and they become completely demotivated. 

[[Addiction]]s create changes in the brain forever. Even after years of not taking the drug, it will take one try to return to addictive behavior. It is possible to de-tour around damaged areas of the brain to create healthy behaviors. 

[[Learning]] creates dopamine in the brain (I think it’s working vice-versa) - Dopamine creates and motivates learning.
