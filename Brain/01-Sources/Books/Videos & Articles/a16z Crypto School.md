Zero-Knowledge Proof mechanism - the way to prove something is right without showing it 

Zk-SNARK is an acronym that stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge.” A zk-SNARK is a cryptographic proof that allows one party to prove it possesses certain information without revealing that information. This proof is made possible using a secret key created before the transaction takes place.

Zk-SNARK is a zero-knowledge proof protocol used in encryption, and is an acronym that stands for "Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge."

This proof was first developed and introduced in the late 1980s, and is now employed by the cryptocurrency Zcash to solve a perceived anonymity problem with Bitcoin-type blockchains.

Zk-SNARK proofs rely on an initial "trust system" setup that has been critiqued as an inherent security flaw.

We should try to store as little data as possible on the blockchain - and this is one of the main tasks. 

That’s why data aggregations are used to summarize and hash the data together

Rollup servers is a concept invented to avoid having to validate blocks by all the participants - now they could only be validated by a series of Rollup Servers. 

Crypto-commitment is a piece of code of a function, or a commitment of funds, that is put in the envelope and then hashed and put on blockchain. 

Databases should not be stored on bliockchain - only hashes of the snapshots of data
