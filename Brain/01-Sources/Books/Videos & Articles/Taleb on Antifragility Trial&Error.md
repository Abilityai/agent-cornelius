You would rather be Antifrigile than smart. IN [[Entrepreneurship]] the best way to do this is through Trial & Error. Most of the stuff ex except Nuclear were found by mistake. 
Cost of an error is low and potential payoff is high. 

[[Education]] inhibits risk-taking. 

Related to [[Cynefin Framework]] which basically says that we should go from Chaos to organization.
