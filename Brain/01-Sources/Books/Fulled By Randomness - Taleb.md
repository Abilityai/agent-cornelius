# Taleb: Fulled By [[Randomness]]
by [[Nassim Taleb]]
[[Random]] [[Decision Making]]

• [[Resulting]] - The quality of a choice cannot be judged just by the result. (I first learned this in baseball. Just because a pitch you call or play you call doesn't work out doesn't make it a poor choice. It could have been the right call, but bad luck. Or vice versa.)

• The ratio of undistllled [[Information]] to distilled is rising. Let's call information that has never had to prove its truth more than once or twice, undistllled. And information that has been filtered through many years, counter arguments, and situations is distilled. You want more distilled information (concepts that stand the test of time and rigorous analysis) and less undistllled information (the news, reactionary opinions, and “cutting edge” research).

• There is nothing wrong with losing. The problem is losing more than you plan to lose. You need clear rules that limit your downside. (“If any investment loses one million dollars then our firm sells immediately.”)

Protect your [[Downside]], or limit it, and then you can play with randomness and manage complex and chaotic context.

There are only two types of [[Idea]]s. Those that have been proven wrong and those which have yet to be proved wrong.

• Strive to become a man of leisure who can afford to sit with ideas, think properly about them, and gradually provide something of value.

• Minor stalemates in life can often be solved by choosing randomly. In many cases it doesn't really matter so long as you choose something and move forward.

• We follow rules not because they are the best options, but because they make things fast and easy.

**• Repetitiveness is key for determining if you are seeing [[skill]] or [[luck]] at play. Can't repeat it? Not skilful.**
