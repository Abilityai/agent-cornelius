[[Evolution]] of [[money]] did not start with barter. 

It started with [[Credit]], then turned into money, and then could turn into barter if money disappeared. 

Obligation or [[Credit]] is a basis of human relationships and they and morality. 

E g. Things were measured and traded based on some fixed value - sheep for example. Everything counted in sheep and based on trust between people. 

[[Money]] showed up when [[Government]]s started to need large armies and needed to pay them in some acceptable [[currency]] - gold coins for examples.

Coins evolved independently and simultaneously in several regions around 600 bc. Then disappeared and reappeared. 

Historically, absence of [[Debt]] between people means absence of relationships. For example, in some [[Culture]]s, if one gave a gift that exactly matched the gift of the other - this was a signal that they don't want to build relationships. 

[[Religion]]s are based on the [[Debt]] that can not be returned at all - nobody can avoid all the deadly sins so we are in a co start debt to [[God]]. Parenting bonds are based on the [[Debt]] to parents. 

Debtors were mostly considered sinners and bad people , which motivated people to return debts. [[Debt]] and [[Guilt]] are the same words in many languages. In general language is describing a lot of relationships in terms of debt. 

[[Gift]] is a form of creating [[Debt]]. Failure to do something is a debt. 

Different governments developed a regular practice of forgiving and writing off debts for the whole country due to the [[Debt]] crisis. It was happening regularly. 

[[Money]] is combining a function of commodity and IOU (I owe you). 

People fluctuate between the use of [[money]] and the use of [[Credit]]. When the dollar disconnected from gold - we started another cycle of [[Credit]] use rather thank money. 

He first (Chapter 2) outlines the liberal/capitalist theory of [[Adam Smith]], suggesting that Smith falsely identifies the logic of “barter” as the constitutive human capacity to justify the market and establish economics as a discipline. What’s wrong with Smith, in Graeber’s view, is that the history he depicts (Barter > [[Money]] > [[Credit]]) happened exactly in the reverse! Pre-money societies weren’t dominated by barter as so much by neighbours keeping tabs on the goods they give to each other in aid (credit). On the historical stage, credit was the first mode of economic [[Behavior]], and it was only until after money came on the stage did people begin bartering when money was not available to them.

In Chapter 4, Graeber gives his definition of money. [[Money]] is both a commodity (Smith) as well as an IOU (primordial [[Debt]]). He goes on to reject the liberal ontologies of both liberal and socialist traditions. Drawing upon [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], Graeber shows that the [[Liberal]] tradition (we don’t owe anyone anything) and the socialist tradition (we owe everyone everything) stems from the same false assumption: they take [[reciprocity]] to be the only logic that governs social relations. That is why both theories are limited in expressing human relations as “owing” something to another.

In Chapter 5, Graeber introduces three distinct types of social logic that he believes governs human relations. 

First, [[Communism]] operates on the logic of “to each according to their need, from each according to their ability.” It describes the human impulse to help without expectation of return when the need is big enough or the ask is small enough. 

Second, exchange operates on the logic of [[equality]]. Both sides feel obliged to return to other what they received. This obligation is [[Debt]]. 

Lastly, [[hierarchy]] operates on the logic of precedent: what is expected from a certain group currently is simply what has been expected from them before. 

With these threefold logic outlined, Graeber gives his definition of what [[Debt]] is: an exchange that has not been brought to completion [[Debt]] is even more unbearable than hierarchy because it operates with the premises of exchange ([[Equality]]) but within the reality of [[hierarchy]] (domination). He claims that the proliferation of the [[market]] and [[economics]], has blinded us to both communism and hierarchy.
