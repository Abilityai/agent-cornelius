[[The deepest meaning comes from suffering]]

The crisis of meaning in 21st century

According to V Frankl, the meaning can come from the 3 sources
1.  What person does (work)
2.  Who person meets (love)
3.  How person suffers. 

If person can not find the [[meaning]], it results in the existential vacuum, which brings to all different kids of psychological and physical problems and even death. [[Happiness]] is a side effect of person’s life with meaning, and it impossible to achieve without it. 

The abundance of everything and consumeristic culture results in the fact that people have less and less [[suffering]] and the only two options they have left to find. They loose material things to strive for, and I mean the ones that are needed for survival - everything is available in their fingertips. So meaning way less often now comes from suffering or striving for something to support life. 

Eliminating [[suffering]] in the modern world results that people can find meaning only in the first 2 sources - [[Love]] and [[Work]]. 

Because of the abundance of choices and [[globalisation]] of the world, the attention is spread across hundreds of virtual friends, and it is harder and harder to build deep relationships and find [[love]]. This is where the loneliness epidemic is coming from. 

So for many people, the only choice they have left is - [[work]]. This is where workaholic culture is coming from, and this is what the constantly growing economy is benefiting from. 

“Live your life as if this is your second life and in the first one you have made all the mistakes and bad decisions that you are about to make now. “

Logo Therapy is centred around the man’s search for meaning the the future, and meaning is considered the base need for the psychological health and absence of the neurosis of a different kind. Man is confronted with the search for the meaning in his life and provided tools for this.
