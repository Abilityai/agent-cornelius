# Atomic Habits - [[James Clear]]
Compound improvements will create significant results over time

[[Habit]]s don’t show much progress until the valley or disappointment is overcome. There’s a threshold after which you start seeing the results, 

You don’t rise to the level of your goals, but you fall to the level of your systems. 

**There are 3 layers of behavioural change:**
1.  [[Outcome]]s
2.  Process (deeper)
3.  [[Identity]] (deepest)

The more you repeat the [[Behavior]] the more you change the [[identity]]. And this happens day by day. 

**Changing the identity is a 2 step process:**
1.  Decide who you want to be
2.  Prove it to yourself with small wins to reinforce your identity

**4 stages of [[Habit]], that are driven by [[Dopamine]]**
1.  [[Cue]]
2.  [[Craving]]
3.  Response
4.  [[Reward]]
  

**4 laws to created good habits:**
1. Cue - Make it obvious 
2. Craving - Make it attractive
3. Response - Make it easy. Minimize the friction to make it happen, e.g. pack gym close in the evening, go to the gym next to you. 
4. Reward - Make it satisfying. 

4 laws to break bad habits:
1.  Cue - Make it invisible
2.  Craving - Make it unattractive
3.  Response - Make it difficult
4.  Reward - Make it unsatisfying

Cues often become invisible.
Implementation intention - a tactic to build a new habit, by making of very specific and clear:

I will do X at time Y and location Z

### [[Habit]] Stacking

After habit X I will do Y. Y is a new habit in this case. 

Temptation Bundling

Combine the [[Behavior]] you like (e.g. watching Netflix) with the habit you want to shape and do 1st only if you do 2nd at the same time. 

Join the culture where your desired [[Behavior]] is a typical behaviour. 

Instead of I have to do X, say I get to do X. This is a light mindset change, but helps a lot. 

[[Habit]] forming depends on frequency not time. 

When forming a habit, the key is to stay under the point when it feels like work. Even if you do just a bit if it in the beginning. 

In order to fight instant gratification (i.e. don’t feel immediate reward for bad habits and do feel it for good ones) - we need to add immediate [[Pleasure]] to the good habits and immediate [[Pain]] to the bad ones. 

When you skip - the rule is NEVER MISS TWICE. Missing twice is a start of a new habit.
