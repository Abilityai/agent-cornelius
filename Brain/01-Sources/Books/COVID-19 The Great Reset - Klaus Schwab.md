# COVID-19: The Great Reset

The world is going to go through drastic changes after Covid

Pandemics are not new and happened all the the time.

There are 3 factors that describe the world today

1. [[Interconnectedness]] - which means that different areas of [[risk]] are very much connected to each other, and that tasks in one area will trigger the issue in another (see chart from global economic forum)
2. [[Velocity]] - the speed of change in this world is very high. We operate in real-time society. This is a «Dictatorship of Urgency» (fast food, real-time trading, in-time delivery. 
For pandemic that is growing exponentially, human mind can’t grasp this concept. When things happen exponentially, in human impression they have 2 stages - gradually and then suddenly. More and more things become [[exponential]] in the modern world. 
[[Interconnectedness]] leads to [[exponential]] effects.
3. [[Complexity]]. Systems of casual non-linear links that is almost impossible to predict.

Pandemic was predicted, it is not a black swan effect, but many of its effects will be black swans.

As the complexity of the world explodes, it becomes close to impossible for men to make the right decisions, and the only possible solution for this is the AI systems.

#### Economic effects

The tradeoff between a few life and economic growth is false, because:

1. If the measures are removed, people will get sick and thus businesses will suffer. On the demand side, people won’t restart buying if they don’t not perceive safety.

Service industries make up to 80% of the economies, and they were hit hardest. Also, they can’t stock up with the inventory, thus these revenues were lost forever.

People are afraid of not finding a job after they lose it, which results in sharp increase of the savings rates.

In all likelihood, the [[recession]] induced by the [[pandemic]] will trigger a sharp increase in labour-substitution, meaning that physical labour will be replaced by robots, [[AI]] and “intelligent” machines, which will in turn provoke lasting and structural changes in the labour market.

In the post-pandemic era, according to current projections, the new economic “normal” may be characterised by much lower growth than in past decades.

[[GDP]] growth model kills the world ecosystem. Constant growth is not sustainable.

Thus some countries are switching to more sustainable models, e.g. New Zealand optimising for the happiness index, and others are adopting doughnut approach, where lower boundary is a minimum what people need, and upper boundary is the max of what people need.

[[GDP]] or growth optimisation forced companies to sell more and more product, and thus - make it breakable etc. The only other approach that can push companies to build reliable and reusable products is the [[subscription]] or rent model.

The pain inflicted by widespread unemployment, lower incomes for large segments of the population and uncertainty about the future are all likely to lead to an increase in precautionary savings.

In the coming years, high-income countries may well face a situation similar to that of Japan over the past few decades: structurally weak demand, very low inflation and ultra-low interest rates.

For a number of reasons, one of which is the US monetary policy and the fact that their spending are larger than their tax base, US dollar may stop being a world currency, and it is unclear what will replace it yet.

In the short term the social inequality will increase (richer people have more access to healthcare and WFH), but in the longer term it may decrease due to a social backlash and new policies advocating equal healthcare etc..

There are increased chances of social unrest in the world post covid. THe higher the unemployment rate the more chances this has got.

Centralised governments are becoming vital again after the Covid. Their influence will grow and focus on the public sector reliability - insurance, healthcare, sustainability. Benefits (sick leave, social insurance, unemployment benefits) will be growing at the cost of higher taxes on the wealthy of this world.

[[Government]] will be intervening in the business reality by providing [[loans]], nationalising or buying [[equity]] in large strategic businesses.

The idea of stakeholder capitalism will have much less impact on the economy.

**Social contracts**

Current social contract will not come back to reality after Covid ends.

People around the world will start realizing that in order to achieve good results public sectors will require investments, not just «efficient management».

Sick leave will have to become mandatory

Another aspect is a permanent surveillance, many countries will want this.

Young generation will take active part in redefining the contract.

**Geopolitical reset**

“There is no new global order, just a chaotic transition to uncertainty.”

«In this messy new world defined by a shift towards multipolarity and intense competition for influence, the conflicts or tensions will no longer be driven by ideology (with the partial and limited exception of radical Islam), but spurred by nationalism and the competition for resources.»

Main global drivers of the future geopolitics are:
the erosion of [[Globalisation]]
the absence of global governance
the increasing rivalry between the US and China
the fate of fragile and failing states

[[Globalisation]] vs [[Nationalism]]
Globalisation creates larger risks of the financial crisis
Pandemic will slow down [[Globalisation]]

[[Globalisation]] Trilemma - «The trilemma suggests that the three notions of economic globalisation, political democracy and the nation state are mutually irreconcilable, based on the logic that only two can effectively co-exist at any given time.»

[[Business]]es will try to shorten their supply chains to avoid risks of breaking it due to another crisis, which will inevitably bring the contraction of the international trade.

This, in turn, means that many export-oriented supplies will need to find local markets or will go bankrupt.

Global Governance

«Put bluntly, we live in a world in which nobody is really in charge.»

It needs to be fixed quickly of we will be living in the uncontrollable global chaos

With Covid-19 US-China relationships are falling apart even more and may result in the new kind of Cold War.

that the damage inflicted by the pandemic to fragile and failing states will be much deeper and longer-lasting than in the richer and most developed economies.
