[[Long-term planning and imagination are unique to humans]]

[[Planning is happening in Frontal Lobe (PFC)]]

[[Awakening and Enlightenment are about being in the Moment, in Here and Now]]

[[When PFC is active during planning, we can not be in Here and Now]]

### **Control**

[[Human Brain wants to Predict because it wants to Control the future Emotions]]

[[People experience pleasure when they have a feeling of Control]]

[[When people lose Control they become helpless and depressed]]

[[Feeling of Control is one of the reasons for Overconfidence effect]]

[[Feeling of control is required for psychological health]]

### **Subjectivity**

[[Happiness]] is a subjective term and notion. Everyone has different definitions. 

Definitions of any subjective ”feelings” (any kind of them, like the feeling of Yellow) is impossible to define in an objective manner. 

Subjective states can not be transferred or explained to anyone. Subjectives states can only be explained in terms of other subjective states or premises. 

**[[Most definitions are the comparisons to other objects in the same ontological group]].** 

However there are three different parts of feelings of [[Happiness]]:
 - Emotional
 - Moral 
 - Rational

Everyone is looking for happiness. That’s the only thing they do. All of them have different ways to achieve happiness, but still looking for happiness. 

[[New forms of Happiness makes you like old happy things less]]

[[Experience]] and [[Awareness]] are different. You can experience something without being aware of it. [[Awareness]] is the experience of our experience. 

### **Chapter 11: [[Mind]]’s blind spot**

[[Brain ignores absence of something and only takes into account what is visible]]

**We make most of the [[decision]]s based on what we think we are going to feel in the [[future]] based on our [[prediction]] of the future after the decision we make.**  

[[Prediction]] of how the [[future]] is going to look like depends on our perception of the [[past]] experience and our current state of [[mind]] (mood). 

[[Memory is a reconstructive process that fills up missing pieces]]

The same mistake our brain makes when imagining the [[future]] - there are very large blind spots based on the facts we don’t think or know about. [[Brain]] fills up all the details for us in the future, those details have nothing to do with the event in the [[future]]. 

[[When imagining the future, brain ignores information that is missing]]

[[When looking for causality brain only takes into account available facts]]

[[Brain understands how close something in time or space based on details]]

[[Suffering in the near future is perceived as harder than suffering in the far future]] 

### **Presentism**

The [[influence]] of the present to our feelings and predictions about the future. 

For the [[past]] - people are replacing the [[memory]] of how they felt about something in the past with how they feel about it right now. 

[[Brain is replacing a memory of feeling with how they would feel about it now]]

[[When imagining the future, people think they would feel the same about situation as now]]

### **[[Pre-feeling]]**

[[More rigorous and rational choice makes us less happy about it]]

[[Pre-feeling is a better predictor of Happiness than thinking]]

[[Brain prioritizes reality over imagination]]

Experience, or feeling is something that comes from what we experience and see now in the world. It comes from the world. It is about NOW. 

[[Pre-feeling comes from memory and pattern recognition]]

People mix them up very often. This is why when asked if they are living a happy life, people answer based on what is happening NOW, e.g. bad weather. 

[[One of the Depression signs is that people can't imagine good things in the future]]

### **Time bombs**

[[We can't imagine time so we perceive it as a space dimension]]

[[People are Happier when they select the same best option than diversity]]

[[Repeated best option choice diminishes in value over time]]

[[Imagination is timeless, we imagine in Now and then correct for time]]

### **Comparison to the past**

[[Brain reacts to relative potential change, not to absolute change]]

[[Anchoring bias caused by the brain reacting to relative potential changes]]

[[Subjective cost of item changes depending on context]]

### **[[Comparison]]**. 

[[Direct Comparison makes us pay attention to previously unimportant facts]]

[[For optimal choice, criteria need to be listed and fixed before the comparison]]

### **Psychological Immunity** 

It finds the balance between reality and seeing it, and between imagination and stories. 

[[Confirmation bias is a way for Brain to adjust reality to our system of beliefs]]

[[Facts are Assumptions that meet a certain Standard of Proof]]

[[Changing Standard of Proof is a form of Confirmation Bias]]

[[Confirmation bias creates a reality illusion that is necessary for people to function]]

[[Brain]] keeps a constant balance between an [[illusion]] and reality. And uses a form of [[confirmation bias]] to confirm the illusion. 

We can’t “adjust” too obvious lies - it does not feel real. We can’t make ourselves enjoy something we don’t like, this is too obvious of a trick to believe in it for our [[brain]]. We need to stumble on the facts that “open” themselves for us

[[People hate more when rejected by a group than a single person]]

[[People regret things they have Not done much more than things they have]]

[[People find much stronger confirmations for higher levels of suffering above threshold]]

[[People find confirmations for the things they can't avoid much easier]]

[[Social Groups help find confirmations to reinforce the beliefs]]

### **[[Explanation]]s**

[[Explanation of bad things can makes us feel better]]

[[Explanation of good things make us feel less happy about them]]

[[Once we explain something - we forget about it]],

### **[[Memory]]**


[[If there's more of something - we can remember it easier]]

[[We remember unusual cases better and think they happen more often]]

[[People remember final moments much better]]

[[Memory]] is a reconstructive process. It can be influenced and remembers the last memory of things, not things.  

### **Theory + Fact as Explanations of the past**

Brain uses a combination of theories or [[Belief]]s and facts to make sense of the past events or feelings. 

When we are remembering the [[feeling]], we reconstruct it based on the belief how you should have felt + facts of circumstances that influenced it. 

If we expected to be happy in the [[past]] based on the circumstances- that’s what we will remember. 

That’s the reason why it’s hard to remember bad [[feeling]]s about mistakes I the past. 

### **[[Meme Evolution]]**
[[Ideas, Beliefs, Memes and Narratives follow evolution process]]

[[Almost every communication is an attempt to influence beliefs]]

[[Ability to elicit Emotional Response drives the spread of a Meme, Idea, Belief]]

[[Relevance to Pop Culture drives the spread of a Meme, Idea, Belief]]

[[Precision was one of the main drivers of the spread of a Meme, Idea, Belief]]

[[Ability to improve Quality of Communication drives the spread of a Meme, Idea, Belief]]

There are examples of the incorrect super-replicators:
 - [[Money as a source of Happiness is a wrong meme super-replicator]]
 - Children. People think it will bring [[happiness]], but the data shows the opposite. Same thing - this is beneficial for people as a whole to have this belief, but not for individual person. 

[[Best way to estimate future feelings is to ask someone in this position, not imagine]]

[[People tend to think about themselves as unique, but they are not]]
Since we think people are too different we don’t trust their emotions about the future. 

[[Fundamental Attribution Error - we attribute behavior of others to character, and ours to circumstances]]
