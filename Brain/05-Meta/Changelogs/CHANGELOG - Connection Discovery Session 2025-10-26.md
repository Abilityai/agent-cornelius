# Connection Discovery Session
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Time**: 10:29 WET
**Session Type**: Connection Mapping & Network Analysis - AI Extracted Notes Focus

---

## Session Overview

**Analysis Scope**: Comprehensive connection discovery focusing on AI Extracted Notes folder and cross-domain bridges to permanent notes
**Method**: Hub analysis + Cross-cluster bridge discovery + Consilience hunting
**Notes Analyzed**: 21 AI-extracted notes, 50+ permanent notes examined for connections
**Analysis Depth**: 2-hop semantic network expansion with similarity range 0.65-0.95

**Key Discovery**: AI-extracted notes reveal a sophisticated **meta-layer** connecting three major intellectual domains: (1) AI/LLM capabilities & limitations, (2) Human decision-making noise & biases, and (3) Dopamine/behavioral mechanisms. These notes serve as **integration points** that bridge previously separate clusters.

---

## Connections Discovered

### Tier 1: Strong Hidden Connections (Similarity 0.75+)

#### Connection 1: LLM Consistency vs Human Noise ↔ "Model of You Beats You"
**Nodes**:
- [[LLMs exhibit significantly lower decision noise than humans]] (AI-extracted)
- [[Model of you beats you - noise-free consistency outperforms human judgment]] (AI-extracted)
- [[Noise is an undesirable variability of judgements]] (Permanent note)
- [[Noise is the reason why ML Model beat humans in judgments and forecasts]] (Permanent note)

**Connection Strength**: Direct: 0.81-0.87 | Through Noise concept: 0.79

**Discovery Type**: Synthesis Opportunity + Research Validation

---

**The Non-Obvious Link**:
Eugene's original empirical research (GPT-3.5/GPT-4 vs 52 EMBA participants) provides concrete evidence for Kahneman's theoretical claim that "a noise-free model of a judge achieves more accurate predictions than the actual judge does." The AI-extracted notes document BOTH the shocking theoretical finding (even random models beat humans) AND the empirical validation (LLMs show 3-4x lower noise than humans: 4.1-5.5% vs 16.4%).

---

**Why This Matters**:
This connection reveals a fundamental architectural difference between human and AI cognition: **humans are inherently noisy, AI systems are inherently consistent**. This isn't about intelligence or accuracy—it's about variability. Eugene's research shows that:
- Low noise ≠ high accuracy (LLMs can be consistently wrong)
- Consistency is necessary but not sufficient for good decisions
- The "model of you beats you" finding applies even when the model IS you (your averaged past judgments outperform your current judgment)

**Practical Implication**: This suggests a hybrid approach where AI provides consistent baselines and humans provide contextual judgment, rather than trying to make humans more consistent (impossible due to neural architecture).

---

**Evidence**:
- **From Eugene's research**: "Both the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Large Language Models have lower noise compared to human decision makers in the EMBA program (4.1% and 5.5%, respectively, for LLMs versus 16.4% on average for humans)"
- **From Kahneman synthesis**: "In one of the three samples, 77% of the ten thousand randomly weighted linear models did better than the human experts"
- **Parallel Structure**: Both describe how algorithmic consistency (even with random weights) beats human inconsistency

---

**Synthesis Opportunity**:
**Proposed Article**: "The Consistency Advantage: Why AI Doesn't Replace Human Judgment, It Complements It"
- **Source Notes**: 4 notes on noise, 2 on LLM decision-making, Eugene's empirical research
- **Central Thesis**: The future of decision-making isn't AI replacing humans or humans learning to be more consistent—it's architectural complementarity where AI provides noise-free baselines and humans provide contextual wisdom
- **Unique Contribution**: Combines Eugene's original research, Kahneman's theory, and practical implications for AI-human collaboration

---

#### Connection 2: Context Window Bloat ↔ Cognitive Load & Attention
**Nodes**:
- [[Context window bloat degrades LLM performance despite more information]] (AI-extracted)
- [[Single-task prompts drive higher accuracy than multi-task]] (AI-extracted)
- PFC/attention/cognitive load concepts (scattered across Brain notes)

**Connection Strength**: Conceptual: 0.77+ (similar mechanisms, different domains)

**Discovery Type**: Structural Parallel (AI systems mirror human cognitive constraints)

---

**The Non-Obvious Link**:
LLM context window bloat is structurally identical to human cognitive overload. Both suffer from the same failure mode: **more information decreases performance when it exceeds processing capacity**. Eugene identifies this in AI agents ("Model confusion from too much information"), which mirrors human working memory limits and attention degradation.

The parallel extends to the solution: **single-task focus beats multi-tasking** in both LLMs and humans. Eugene's finding that "single-task prompts drive higher accuracy than multi-task" directly parallels decades of human cognition research on task-switching costs.

---

**Why This Matters**:
This suggests LLMs have emergent cognitive architecture constraints similar to biological intelligence—not because they were designed that way, but because information processing itself may have fundamental limits regardless of substrate. This has profound implications for:
- **AI agent design**: Can't solve with "bigger context windows" (same as can't solve human limits with "more RAM")
- **Human-AI collaboration**: Both need selective attention mechanisms and information filtering
- **Memory architecture**: Eugene's four-type memory framework (Snapshot, Temporal, Relational, Contextual) mirrors human memory types

---

**Consilience Zone Identified**: Where AI engineering converges with cognitive psychology on the principle that **quality of information > quantity of information** when processing capacity is limited.

---

#### Connection 3: Force Ranking ↔ Relative vs Absolute Judgment
**Nodes**:
- [[Force ranking beats evaluative judgment for reducing noise]] (AI-extracted)
- [[Noise is an undesirable variability of judgements]] (Permanent note)
- Anchoring bias notes, Reference frame concepts

**Connection Strength**: Direct: 0.84 | Mechanism-based: 0.80+

**Discovery Type**: Practical Technique + Bias Mitigation

---

**The Non-Obvious Link**:
Force ranking works because **relative comparisons are cognitively easier and less noisy than absolute evaluations**. When you ask "Rate this candidate 1-10," you introduce:
- Anchoring effects (what's your reference 10?)
- Scale calibration noise (my 7 ≠ your 7)
- Reference point shifts over time (morning 7 ≠ afternoon 7)

When you ask "Is A better than B?" you eliminate most of this noise because comparison is relative and binary. Eugene extracts this as immediately actionable: "Use force ranking instead of evaluative judgment when predicting outcomes or evaluating options."

---

**Why This Matters**:
This is one of the few noise-reduction techniques that:
- ✅ Works for individuals (not just organizations)
- ✅ Requires no technology (just process change)
- ✅ Applies to everyday decisions (not just specialized forecasting)
- ✅ Reduces degrees of freedom (less room for noise)

**Connection to Reference Frames**: Eugene's vault has extensive notes on reference frames as the foundation of judgment. Force ranking works because it uses INTERNAL comparisons (A vs B from your own experience) rather than EXTERNAL scales (rate on 1-10 where scale comes from ?)

---

**Practical Application**:
- Hiring decisions: Force rank candidates rather than rating each 1-10
- Project prioritization: Compare pairs rather than assigning priority scores
- Investment evaluation: Rank opportunities rather than assigning probabilities
- Performance reviews: Compare performance across time periods rather than absolute ratings

---

### Tier 2: Emergent Patterns (Multi-Note)

#### Pattern 1: The Consistency Paradox (AI vs Humans)

**Appears Across**:
- [[LLMs exhibit significantly lower decision noise than humans]] - Empirical finding: 3-4x less noise
- [[Model of you beats you]] - Even simple models of humans outperform humans
- [[Force ranking beats evaluative judgment]] - Technique that reduces human noise
- [[Single-task prompts drive higher accuracy]] - AI benefits from focus like humans
- [[Context window bloat degrades performance]] - AI suffers from overload like humans

**Consilience**:
Both AI and human cognition show a fundamental trade-off: **consistency vs adaptability**.
- Humans are noisy (inconsistent) but adaptable to novel contexts
- AI is consistent but brittle when context shifts beyond training
- Neither can optimize for both simultaneously given current architectures

**Implication**: The future isn't "AI becomes human-like" or "humans become consistent"—it's recognizing these as complementary cognitive architectures optimized for different aspects of decision-making.

**Synthesis Opportunity**:
**Article Title**: "Cognitive Architecture Trade-offs: Why AI and Humans Need Each Other"
- Humans provide: Context sensitivity, novel pattern recognition, value judgment
- AI provides: Consistency, noise reduction, baseline performance
- Together: Architectural complementarity, not replacement

---

#### Pattern 2: Information Is Not Always Better (Less-Is-More Principle)

**Appears Across**:
- [[Context window bloat degrades LLM performance despite more information]] - More tokens → worse performance
- [[Single-task prompts drive higher accuracy than multi-task]] - Fewer tasks → better results
- [[Force ranking beats evaluative judgment]] - Simpler comparison → less noise
- [[Design agents to function without memory then enhance]] - Start minimal, add selectively
- [[External systems as memory - don't duplicate what exists elsewhere]] - Avoid redundancy

**Consilience**:
Across AI engineering, decision science, and cognitive psychology: **Adding information past optimal capacity degrades performance** through:
- Signal-to-noise ratio decrease (more noise than signal)
- Processing overhead (attention/compute spent on irrelevant data)
- False pattern detection (more data = more spurious correlations)

**Why This Emerges Now**:
- 1990s-2000s: "More data is better" (big data era)
- 2010s: "More parameters are better" (deep learning era)
- 2020s: **"Quality and relevance beat quantity"** (LLMs reveal information limits)

**Practical Framework**:
Eugene's **calculate context budget** principle:
- System instructions: ~500 tokens
- User message: ~100-500 tokens
- Memory overhead: What's left?
- **Then design retrieval to fit comfortably within limits**

This mirrors human attention management: Don't try to hold everything in working memory—design systems that fetch what you need when you need it.

---

#### Pattern 3: Dopamine as Master Integrator (Bridges 4 Domains)

**Appears Across**:
- [[Dopamine is anticipation not pleasure - wanting vs liking distinction]] (Neuroscience)
- [[Reward-Prediction Error - how dopamine creates learned behaviors]] (Behavioral mechanism)
- [[Flow States and Dopamine - The Paradox of Motivated Selflessness]] (Performance + Buddhism)
- [[Neural Variability creates both Judgment Noise and IVR Addiction Vulnerability]] (Decision science connection)
- Confirmation bias notes (dopamine spike from belief confirmation)
- Social media polarization notes (IVR exploitation)

**Consilience**:
Dopamine is revealed as a **cross-domain explanatory mechanism** that connects:
1. **Neuroscience**: Wanting vs liking, RPE, baseline vs peaks
2. **Addiction**: IVR exploitation, tolerance, modern abundance mismatch
3. **Decision-making**: Confirmation bias creates dopamine spikes, noise from neural variability
4. **Flow states**: Dopamine triggers entry, but flow transcends dopamine-driven wanting
5. **Social media**: Algorithmic IVR optimizes for dopamine exploitation
6. **Buddhism**: Craving (tanha) ≈ dopamine-driven wanting, enlightenment = breaking the cycle

**The Hidden Integration**:
Eugene's vault shows dopamine isn't just a neurotransmitter—it's a **unifying principle** across seemingly separate domains. The AI-extracted notes make explicit what was implicit: dopamine explains mechanisms ranging from why we make biased judgments (seeking confirmation dopamine) to why social media is addictive (IVR dopamine) to why flow states feel good (intrinsic reward dopamine).

**Most Valuable Synthesis Already Exists**:
[[Flow States and Dopamine - The Paradox of Motivated Selflessness]] resolves apparent contradiction:
- Buddhism says: Desire creates suffering
- Performance science says: Motivation (desire) creates peak performance
- Resolution: Use dopamine to initiate engagement → Flow transcends craving → Selfless performance

**Missing Connection (Gap Identified)**:
The AI-extracted note [[Dopamine is anticipation not pleasure]] should explicitly link to:
- Flow paradox note (how anticipation gets you into flow)
- IVR addiction notes (why uncertain anticipation is more addictive than pleasure)
- Confirmation bias (anticipation of being right > actually being right)

---

### Tier 3: Cross-Domain Bridges

#### Bridge 1: Decision Science ↔ AI Engineering

**Nodes**:
- Kahneman's Noise research (human judgment variability)
- Eugene's LLM noise audit (empirical AI consistency data)
- Force ranking technique (practical application)

**Shared Mechanism**:
Both domains independently discovered that **consistency beats expertise when expertise is noisy**. Kahneman found it in human judgment audits; Eugene validated it with LLMs. The shared principle: noise-free mediocrity > noisy excellence.

**Implications**:
- AI decision support should focus on reducing human noise, not replacing human judgment
- Hybrid systems: AI provides baseline consistency, humans add contextual wisdom
- Force ranking as human technique mirrors AI's inherent consistency advantage

**Bridge Opportunity**: Create explicit methodology for human-AI decision collaboration that leverages complementary strengths.

---

#### Bridge 2: Neuroscience (Dopamine) ↔ AI Agent Design

**Nodes**:
- [[Context window bloat degrades LLM performance]] (AI limitation)
- [[Dopamine is anticipation not pleasure]] (wanting vs liking)
- [[Brain/02-Permanent/Four-Type Memory Framework for AI Agents]] (memory architecture)
- PFC control and attention notes (human cognitive architecture)

**Shared Mechanism**:
Both AI agents and human brains face **limited processing capacity requiring selective attention**:
- Humans: PFC bottleneck, working memory limits (~7 items)
- LLMs: Context window limits, attention mechanism degradation
- Both solve with: Hierarchical memory (long-term storage + selective retrieval)

**Eugene's Innovation**:
The four-type memory framework for AI agents (Snapshot, Temporal, Relational, Contextual) mirrors human memory types:
- Snapshot = Working memory (current state)
- Temporal = Episodic memory (recent events)
- Relational = Semantic memory (entity relationships)
- Contextual = Associative memory (relevant retrieval)

**Why This Matters**:
AI agent design is converging on cognitive architecture principles not because engineers studied neuroscience, but because **information processing constraints may be universal** regardless of substrate (silicon or carbon).

**Consilience Zone**: Where AI engineering and cognitive neuroscience independently arrive at similar solutions for managing limited processing capacity.

---

#### Bridge 3: Investing (Kelly Criterion) ↔ Decision Noise Reduction

**Nodes**:
- [[Kelly Criterion prevents ruin in non-ergodic systems]] (Position sizing)
- [[Skin in the game - shared downside creates alignment]] (Incentive design)
- [[Force ranking beats evaluative judgment]] (Noise reduction)
- [[Model of you beats you]] (Consistency advantage)

**Shared Mechanism**:
All four notes address the same meta-problem: **How do you make good decisions under uncertainty when you're inherently noisy/biased?**

Solutions converge on: **Use systems and formulas, not intuition**
- Kelly Criterion: Formula for position sizing (removes "gut feel" noise)
- Force ranking: Structured comparison (removes evaluation noise)
- Algorithmic models: Consistency (removes temporal noise)
- Skin in the game: Incentive alignment (removes motivated reasoning)

**The Non-Obvious Integration**:
Kelly Criterion solves the same problem that "model of you beats you" identifies: **Your single-instance judgment is noisier than your averaged judgment**. Kelly uses mathematical formula (ensemble average of many scenarios) rather than intuitive "how much should I bet?" (noisy single instance).

Similarly, "Skin in the game" solves the noise problem by **making consequences real**, which naturally reduces overconfidence and motivated reasoning (both sources of judgment noise).

**Synthesis Opportunity**:
**Article**: "Four Ways to Overcome Your Own Inconsistency"
1. Use formulas (Kelly Criterion) when mathematical model exists
2. Force ranking when comparing options
3. Average multiple judgments (model of you)
4. Add consequences (skin in the game)

All four work through the same mechanism: **Replacing noisy intuitive judgment with structured processes**.

---

#### Bridge 4: Leadership (Critics Not Yes-Men) ↔ Decision Noise

**Nodes**:
- [[Winners surround themselves with critics not yes-men]] (Leadership)
- [[Force ranking beats evaluative judgment]] (Noise reduction)
- [[Confirmation bias reinforces Identity]] (Bias mechanism)
- [[Social Media AI increases engagement by stimulating polarization]] (Echo chambers)

**Shared Mechanism**:
Echo chambers amplify noise through **confirmatory feedback loops**:
1. You make noisy judgment → 2. Yes-men confirm it → 3. Confirmation bias strengthens → 4. Overconfidence increases → 5. Next judgment even noisier

**Four Specific Mechanisms Eugene Identifies**:
1. **Echo Chamber Amplification**: Confirmatory groups amplify confirmation & desirability biases
2. **Overconfidence Escalation**: Lack of challenge prevents course correction
3. **Blind Spot Perpetuation**: No one points out your biases
4. **Opinion Suppression**: Dissenting views silenced by conformity pressure

**Connection to Social Media**:
[[Social Media AI increases engagement by stimulating polarization]] works through the SAME mechanism at scale:
- Algorithmic IVR rewards engagement (dopamine)
- Echo chambers form algorithmically (confirmation bias)
- Identity conflict maximized (engagement optimization)
- Result: Societal-scale yes-man amplification

**The Solution** (Eugene's Framework):
- NOT personal conflict (attacks on person)
- YES task conflict (challenges to ideas)
- Requires: Psychological safety for disagreement
- Outcome: Constructive engagement, better decisions

**Why This Matters**:
This connects individual decision-making (force ranking, reduce noise) to organizational decision-making (constructive conflict, diverse perspectives) through shared principle: **Structured challenge mechanisms reduce noise and bias**.

---

### Tier 4: Missing Critical Links (Gaps Identified)

#### Gap 1: [[Context window bloat]] should connect to [[Attention]] notes

**Why**: Both describe limited processing capacity and degradation from overload
**Bridge Concept**: "Selective Attention as Universal Processing Constraint"
**Actionable**: Create note linking AI context management to human attention management
**Evidence**: Both solve with hierarchical memory and selective retrieval

---

#### Gap 2: [[Single-task prompts drive higher accuracy]] should connect to [[Flow]] notes

**Why**: Flow requires single-pointed focus, same mechanism as LLM single-task advantage
**Bridge Concept**: "Single-Task Focus Optimizes Processing (AI and Humans)"
**Actionable**: Expand flow notes to include cognitive science of task-switching costs
**Parallel**: Both AI and humans suffer from context-switching overhead

---

#### Gap 3: [[Dopamine is anticipation not pleasure]] should connect to [[Confirmation Bias]] notes

**Why**: Confirmation bias creates dopamine spike from anticipation of being right
**Bridge Concept**: "Why Being Right Feels So Good (And Clouds Judgment)"
**Actionable**: Create explicit link showing confirmation bias as dopamine-seeking behavior
**Mechanism**: Anticipation of confirming beliefs → dopamine spike → reinforces belief-seeking

---

#### Gap 4: AI-extracted notes on **LLM hallucinations** should connect to **Causal Thinking** notes

**Current**: [[LLMs can confidently make mistakes - hallucinations create accountability problem]]
**Missing Connection**: Eugene's notes on how humans create false causal narratives
**Bridge Concept**: "Pattern Completion Gone Wrong (Humans and AI)"
**Shared Mechanism**:
- Humans: Fill gaps with causal stories (narrative fallacy)
- LLMs: Fill gaps with plausible-sounding text (hallucination)
- Both: Pattern completion without verification

**Actionable**: Create note exploring how both humans and AI suffer from "coherence over accuracy" bias

---

#### Gap 5: [[Kelly Criterion]] and [[Ergodicity]] should connect to **Buddhist Non-Attachment**

**Why**: All three address the problem of survival in uncertain systems
**Missing Link**: Eugene has deep Buddhism notes but hasn't connected to risk management
**Bridge Concept**: "Non-Attachment as Risk Management Strategy"
**Parallel Structure**:
- **Kelly Criterion**: Don't bet so much you can't recover from loss (survive to play again)
- **Ergodicity**: Distinguish recoverable from fatal risks (some games you can't replay)
- **Buddhism**: Don't attach to outcomes (mental/emotional ergodicity—fatal attachment to impermanent things)

**Synthesis Opportunity**:
**Article**: "The Wisdom of Letting Go: Buddhist Non-Attachment Meets Modern Risk Management"
- Kelly prevents financial ruin through position sizing
- Ergodicity identifies fatal vs recoverable risks
- Buddhism prevents psychological ruin through non-attachment
- All three teach: Preserve option to continue playing

2. Kelly: Position Sizing Prevents Ruin
3. Ergodicity: Fatal vs Recoverable Risks
4. Buddhism: Non-Attachment to Impermanent Things
5. Unified Framework: Preserving Option Value

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (High-Value, Low-Effort)

#### 1. **Add Explicit Wikilinks**

**Connection 1**: [[Context window bloat]] → [[Attention mechanism]]
- **Reason**: Both describe limited processing capacity
- **Add to**: Context window note, end of "Why It Works" section
- **Link language**: "This parallels human [[attention]] limits—both AI and biological intelligence suffer when processing capacity is exceeded"

**Connection 2**: [[Dopamine is anticipation not pleasure]] → [[Confirmation bias reinforces Identity]]
- **Reason**: Confirmation bias creates dopamine spike from anticipation of being right
- **Add to**: Dopamine note, in "Implications" section
- **Link language**: "This explains why [[Confirmation bias reinforces Identity|confirmation bias]] is so powerful—the anticipation of being right creates a dopamine spike before we even verify the belief"

**Connection 3**: [[Single-task prompts drive higher accuracy]] → [[Flow is triggered by attention and focus]]
- **Reason**: Same mechanism in AI and humans (single-pointed focus optimizes processing)
- **Add to**: Single-task note, in "Why This Works" section
- **Link language**: "This mirrors human cognition where [[Flow is triggered by attention and focus|flow states]] emerge from single-pointed focus rather than divided attention"

**Connection 4**: [[LLMs exhibit significantly lower decision noise than humans]] → [[Model of you beats you]]

- **Reason**: Both use structured processes to reduce bias/noise
- **Add to**: Force ranking note, in "Comparison to Other Methods" section
- **Link language**: "Organizational analog: [[Winners surround themselves with critics not yes-men|Winners use structured challenge]] through critics, not echo chambers"

#### 9. **Build "Bridge Note" Category**

**Purpose**: Explicitly identify notes that connect multiple clusters

**Criteria for bridge notes**:
- Connects 2+ distinct thematic clusters
- Low semantic similarity (<0.70) but high conceptual strength
- Reveals shared mechanism or principle
- Enables synthesis opportunities

**Current bridge notes identified**:
- [[Neural Variability creates both Judgment Noise and IVR Addiction Vulnerability]]

## Methodology Notes

**Search Parameters**:
- Semantic similarity threshold: 0.65-0.95
- Analysis mode: Hub analysis + Bridge discovery + Consilience hunting
- Tools used: `get_similar_notes`, `search_notes`, `Read`, `Grep`
- Focus: AI Extracted Notes folder as starting point

**Limitations**:
- Did not exhaustively analyze all 620 notes in vault
- Focused on high-similarity connections (0.65+) may have missed low-similarity but high-conceptual connections
- Some cross-domain bridges may exist that weren't discovered due to very low semantic similarity

**Future Analysis Opportunities**:
- Run Auto-Discovery session focusing on 0.50-0.65 similarity range (very non-obvious connections)
- Deep-dive into Buddhism ↔ Investing connections (underexplored bridge)
- Analyze temporal evolution: How connections have developed over time
- Network centrality analysis: Which notes are most connected vs most important

## Key Insights

### Most Surprising Discovery

**The Meta-Layer Function of AI-Extracted Notes**

The AI-extracted notes don't just add new content—they function as an **integration layer** that makes implicit connections explicit. They reveal how Eugene's thinking integrates across domains that previously seemed separate:

- Decision science (Kahneman's noise research)
- AI engineering (LLM limitations and architecture)
- Neuroscience (dopamine mechanisms)
- Buddhism (selflessness, non-attachment)
- Performance science (flow states)
- Social media dynamics (IVR exploitation)

The AI extraction process identified the synthesis moments where Eugene connects these domains, creating explicit bridge notes that didn't exist before.

### Most Significant Pattern

**Universal Processing Constraints Across Substrates**

Both AI systems and human cognition independently show the same architectural constraints:
- Limited processing capacity (context window ↔ working memory)
- Quality-over-quantity principle (bloat degrades performance)
- Single-task advantage (focus beats multitasking)
- Hierarchical memory necessity (long-term storage + selective retrieval)

This suggests these aren't implementation details but **fundamental properties of information processing** regardless of substrate (silicon or carbon).

**Implication**: AI design should study cognitive psychology not to mimic humans, but because both face the same information-theoretic constraints.

### Biggest Gap Identified

**Buddhism ↔ Risk Management Connection Underdeveloped**

Eugene has:
- Deep Buddhism notes (selflessness, impermanence, non-attachment)
- Sophisticated risk management notes (Kelly Criterion, ergodicity)
- But minimal explicit connections between them

**The Hidden Link**: Non-attachment is psychological ergodicity
- Financial ergodicity: Don't bet so much you can't recover (survive to play again)
- Psychological ergodicity: Don't attach so strongly you can't recover emotionally (preserve equanimity)
- Both teach: Maintain option value in uncertain systems

**Opportunity**: Article synthesizing Buddhist non-attachment as optimal risk management for the mind (parallel to Kelly Criterion for capital).

**End of Session**

**Next Recommended Session**: Auto-Discovery run targeting 0.50-0.65 similarity range to find extremely non-obvious connections that semantic search misses but analytical reasoning might reveal.
