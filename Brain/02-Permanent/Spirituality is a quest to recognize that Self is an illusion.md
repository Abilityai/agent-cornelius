The whole spiritual journey has one goal - recognizing that [[Self]] is an illusion and learning to leave in this new condition. 


[[Self is impossible to find, but possible to find its absence]]

[[Self is gradually shaped by other people and groups through Identity]]
[[Self is a feeling that is created by consciousness, by thoughts]]
