Lightly stimulating activity occupies the conscious mind that allows to pass the problem from conscious to subconscious. And subconscious is a better problem solver. 

We can give tasks to [[Subconscious]] using the [[MacGyver Method]]:
1. Write down your problem. As detailed as possible. As specific as possible. 
2. Step away from them problem for 4-5 hours into this light activity or sleep. 
3. During this do something lightly stimulating. TV and social does not work. Exercise can work - but only if light. 
4. Free writing - sit back and start writing anything. After a few minutes answers will start coming.
