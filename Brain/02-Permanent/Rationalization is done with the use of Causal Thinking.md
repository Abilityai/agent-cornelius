[[People are often making decisions with System 1 and only rationalizing with System 2]]

The socially accepted form of rationalization is done through the causal links, which is a [[Causal Thinking]]. 

For example, [[Stock Market]] goes up or down, and journalists explain it with some stories building causal links. This is [[Causal Thinking]] in a nutshell, and this is also related to the [[Narrative Fallacy]]. Our natural inclination is to grab the first available explanation and then grab supporting evidence to prove it - [[Confirmation Bias]].
