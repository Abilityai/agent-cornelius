[[Judging people by Results is only reasonable for verifiable judgments]]

[[Resulting causes people to make safe decisions]]

This, in turn, causes them to take the safe path, meaning chose obvious options, like buying IBM, because nobody can blame you for buying IBM.

In situations when peoples main optimisation function is to not be fired, ie not being wrong they can start making decisions only based on consensus. Because if the whole team said Yes - you can’t be wrong, or rather you were as wrong as the rest. So you can’t be fired for the mistake.

As a result you get a culture of Yes-men. And decisions are made only by the full consensus.
