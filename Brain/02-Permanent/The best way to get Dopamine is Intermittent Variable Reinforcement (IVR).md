⚠️ **The Randomness Paradox:** The neural variability that makes IVR so effective at creating addiction is THE SAME variability that creates [[Noise is an undesirable variability of judgements|judgment noise]] in decision-making. See [[Neural Variability creates both Judgment Noise and IVR Addiction Vulnerability]] for the full connection.
