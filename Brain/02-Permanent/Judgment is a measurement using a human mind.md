**Your [[Mind]] as a Measurement instrument**

[[Judgment]] is a measurement where the instrument is a human mind

If you take a clock and measure several rounds of 10 seconds, then the variability you produce is the instance of noise. 

We can think of most judgments, specifically predictive judgments, as similar to the measurements you of time on your phone. When we make a prediction, we attempt to come close to the true value.

Thus, noise, or variability in the judgement implies error, because when the judgement is aiming at the true value - two different judgements can not be right. 

Like a measuring instrument, the human mind is imperfect—it is both biased and noisy.

This measurement is based on [[Identity]] and [[Belief]]
