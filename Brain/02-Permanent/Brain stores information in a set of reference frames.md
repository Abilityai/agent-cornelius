[[Reference frame is a set of categories of a specific class or ontological group]]

Anything we have in our mind belongs to a number of reference frames that describe it. 

[[Each notion or object is a set of  Beliefs - positions in a set of reference frames]]
[[Thinking is building decision trees based on position of objects in a reference frame]]
[[Intellectual growth is built around building and improving reference frames]]
