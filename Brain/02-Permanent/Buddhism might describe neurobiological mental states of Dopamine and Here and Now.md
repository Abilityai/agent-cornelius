[[In Buddhism - Duhkha is the reason for all the suffering]]
[[In Buddhism - desire to achieve or get rid of something creates Duhkha]]

It seems that [[Duhkha]] describes the states of [[Mind]] associated with the spiked of [[Dopamine]] and [[Brain/Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]] mechanism in the brain. Like a construction ant cycles of [[Cue]] -> [[Reward]] that never ends and does not bring [[Happiness]] at the end - just creates more [[Suffering]].

And at the same time
[[Awakening and Enlightenment are about being in the Moment, in Here and Now]]
This feeling of being in the moment describes being the mental state of [[HnN]] molecules - where you can feel happiness, joy and piece.
