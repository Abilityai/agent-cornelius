# AI Agents face a Prototype-to-Production Gap

Despite massive investment growth ($250M in 2022 → $1B in 2024), AI agents struggle to transition from prototype stage to production stage. Technical challenges include losing context and getting stuck in consideration loops, preventing fully autonomous deployment.

## Connections

- [[Noise is an undesirable variability of judgements]] - AI agents exhibit variability in performance
- [[Flow consists of 4 stages - Struggle, Release, Flow, Recovery]] - Agents getting "stuck" represents failure to enter flow
- [[Decision-Making process needs to be optimised to improve non-verifiable judgments]] - Production deployment requires consistent decision quality

## Implications

The gap between prototype and production reveals that:
- Demonstrations don't equal deployability
- Context management is critical for agent reliability
- Investment capital doesn't solve technical stability problems
- Fully autonomous agents remain in early stages despite hype
