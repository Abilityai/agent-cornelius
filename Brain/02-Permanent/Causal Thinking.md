There are two types of thinking they describe. 
Based on the book [[Noise]]

**[[Probabilistic thinking]]**, where you look at the averages etc. It is effortful and requires resources. It should begin with data, with ensembles, and considers individual cases as instances of broader categories. 

**[[Causal Thinking]]** where people and objects affect each other. Whatever happens, causal thinking makes it entirely predictable and explainable. It makes it feel like we understand it. Like a Hindsight bias. 

This is applicable to the events that are in the valley of norm, i.e. they are not expected yet unsurprising and they look normal in the hindsight. For example, when you read a book things you read don’t come as a surprise, but they make sense in hindsight

[[Understanding is an illusion based on Causal Thinking]]

It is the occurrence of the event that tells you its cause. When you explain the unexpected but unsurprising outcome this way, the destination you reach always makes sense. 

This is how you “understand” the story and this is what makes reality appear predictable in hindsight. We are under the illusion that it could have been anticipated.

[[Understanding makes the story feel predictable in the hindsight]]

So we come up with stories to explain the world, to find causes of events. This search for causes is almost always successful. Only when our model of the world can not be tweaked to explain the event, we tag it as surprising, and then we can start actual search for causes. Genuine surprise occurs only when routing hindsight fails. 

Continuous causal interpretation of reality is how we understand the world. 

Relying on Causal thinking based on the single case is the source of prediction errors. 

Examples

They failed because they lacked experience.

They succeeded because they had great leadership.
