# AI Agents are digital organisms requiring human attention to survive

AI agents behave like digital Tamagotchi - they survive only as long as humans feed them with attention, development, and usage. When interest wanes, the agent "dies" through neglect, lack of upgrades, or obsolescence.

This creates an **attention-dependent existence** where:
- **Maintenance = survival energy**: Active development keeps agents alive
- **Usage = validation of fitness**: Deployed agents prove their value
- **Abandonment = death**: Forgotten agents decay into irrelevance

The parallel to biological organisms is striking: just as organisms need energy to maintain complexity against entropy, AI agents need human cognitive energy (attention, development time) to maintain relevance against technological drift.

**Implications:**
- Agent survival depends on capturing and maintaining human interest
- The "attention economy" extends to AI systems themselves
- Agent design must optimize for sustained human engagement

**Related Concepts:**
- [[Human attention as evolutionary selection pressure for AI agents]]
- [[Attention is a scarce resource]]
- [[Social Media AI increases engagement by stimulating polarization]]
- [[Dopamine drives motivation and attention]]

**Questions:**
- What happens when agents can maintain themselves?
- Is this sustainable as the number of agents grows exponentially?
- Do agents evolve features specifically to capture human attention?
