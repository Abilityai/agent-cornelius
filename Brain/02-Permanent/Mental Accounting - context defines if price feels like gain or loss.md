[[Prospect Theory - loss and gain are assessed asymmetrically]]

The [[Reference Frame]] or [[Context]] that you use for the price of something Is defining if this purchase is going to be considered a gain or a loss. E.g. buying a beer in the hotel or a cheap shop have different expectations. 

Specific scenario can be re-setting a reference frame to a higher value and then initiating purchase. When you don’t have a reference frame it’s easy to buy something and not feel loss. Until you know the frame.
