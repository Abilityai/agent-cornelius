[[Flow is the most effective state of high-performers]]

[[Flow]] cycle has a 4-stages. You have to complete the whole cycle to re-enter flow. 

##### 1. Struggle. 
This is a loading phase, full of effort, [[learning]] and frustration. [[PFC]] is active in this phase to collect the information. If creates the need for the brain to pick [[Fight or Flight]] response. Flow starts only if you pick to fight, if you chose to deal with the situation. This is a learning phase. In this stage you should introduce [[Novelty]], Complexity and Unpredictability. 
Avoid High Consequences in this stage. This is too dangerous. 
This stage is driven by [[Executive Attention Network]] in the brain
 
##### 2. Release. 
[[Lightly stimulating activity passes creative tasks to subconscious]]
This is where you process Light physical activity or something else that take mind off the challenge. 
This phase is driven by [[Default Model Network (DMN)]]. It allows the brain's pattern recognition system to work, while you do other stuff. 
 - Don’t exhaust yourself. Or sleep afterwards. 
 - TV and social media won’t work
 - Deep embodiment. 
   
##### 3. Flow. 
This is the state itself. The goal here is to maximize the time to stay here. 
To stay there avoid the 4 blockers: 
 - Distractions and interruptions. Once out of the flow it's very hard to come back. 
 - Negative thinking
 - Non-optimal arousal
 - Lack of preparation. Key skills and abilities need to be automatic, otherwise you can't get into flow. 

If you want to stay in the flow for longer or go deeper you need to engage [[Dopamine]] by adding [[Novelty]], Complexity or Unpredictability and additional Dopamine triggers. Add more [[Risk]]. 

[[We make errors in Flow, it is not for strategic planning]]

##### 4. Recovery. 
[[Active Recovery is critical for returning to Flow]]
