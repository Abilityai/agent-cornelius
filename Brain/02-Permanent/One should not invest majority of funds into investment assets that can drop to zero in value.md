[[Ergodicity - in system with fatal events Time and Ensemble probability work differently]]

If you have a chance to lose all your money during [[Investing]] - you are not in [[Ergodic system]], which means that probabilities work differently from [[Ergodic system]]. This means if your investment has even low chances of a complete bust - you can't put all the money into it, even if the [[Upside]] is huge. 

You can take advantage of [[Investing]] in [[Non-Ergodic System]] only if you have endless pockets. Otherwise you [[Risk]] losing everything. 

[[Investor can make themselves more Ergodic using Diversification]]
