Our [[Mind]] is built in a way that we can only hold one perspective in our mind at one time, and that's all. Once we start categorizing world and splitting it onto the concepts and beliefs - we can only take one belief as ours. We can only hold one [[perspective]] in our mind at a time.

[[Once we take a view (perspective, position, belief) we leave something out]]
