Is a cognitive [[bias]] that occurs when the valuation of a problem is not valued with a multiplicative relationship to its size. Scope neglect is a specific form of extension neglect.[1]

In one study, respondents were asked how much they were willing to pay to prevent migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds by covering the oil ponds with protective nets. Subjects were told that either 2,000, or 20,000, or 200,000 migrating birds were affected annually, for which subjects reported they were willing to pay $80, $78 and $88 respectively.[2] Other studies of willingness-to-pay to prevent harm have found a logarithmic relationship or no relationship to scope size

It is probably related to [[Attribute Substitution]] as people are forgetting about the scope and answering the question about how much they are ready to contribute. 

It often shows up with the Timeframe as a Scope. If someone is asked whether something is going to happen in a month or in a year - you may get the same result. This could be critical for [[Investing]].
