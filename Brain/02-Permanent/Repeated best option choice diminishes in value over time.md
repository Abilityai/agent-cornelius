[[People are Happier when they select the same best option than diversity]]

However,  when you have the same over and over again - it loses value [[Law of Diminishing Returns]] . This can only be fixed by diversity (increase number of options) and time (increase time breaks). When one approach is used (e.g. time breaks) the other one is not necessary or event harmful. Time recovers the value of the best option, so shifting it later (choosing another options) would not make sense.
