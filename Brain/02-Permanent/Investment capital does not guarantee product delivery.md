# Investment capital does not guarantee product delivery

Some AI agent companies raised over $100M and still have not released a product. This demonstrates that capital availability doesn't solve fundamental technical or execution challenges.

## Connections

- [[Survivorship Bias]] - We focus on successful raises, not failed deliveries
- [[Outcome Bias]] - Judging quality by funding amount rather than product reality
- [[Skin in the game]] - Investor capital ≠ builder execution capability
- [[Causal Thinking makes us believe the world is more predictable than it is]] - Assuming funding causes success

## Implications

- Funding is necessary but not sufficient for product creation
- Technical difficulty can't be solved purely with resources
- Market expectations (from funding) don't match technical reality
- Process and capability matter more than capital for AI agents

## Pattern

This mirrors historical tech bubbles where capital abundance preceded reality checks. The prototype-to-production gap cannot be bridged with money alone—it requires solving fundamental technical challenges around context management, reliability, and autonomous decision-making.
