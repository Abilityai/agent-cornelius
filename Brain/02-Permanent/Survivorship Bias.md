# Survivorship Bias

The logical error of concentrating on the people or things that ‘survived’ some process and inadvertently overlooking those that did not because of their lack of visibility.

Example - airplanes in WW2 that had been reinforced in places where there were the most holes, while it should have been vice-versa
