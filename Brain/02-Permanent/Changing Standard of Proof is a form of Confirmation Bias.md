[[Confirmation bias is a way for Brain to adjust reality to our system of beliefs]]
[[Confirmation Bias reinforces Identity through confirming Beliefs]]
[[Facts are Assumptions that meet a certain Standard of Proof]]

When people run into the fact that contradicts their belief - they tend to change the [[Standard of Proof]] in order to have a reason to stay with the same belief. 

People use the [[Standard of Proof]] that confirms their story - softer one for the facts that prove our story, and harder ones for the ones we want to disprove. This is a form of [[Confirmation Bias]] 

We chose SoP based on which one helps us to prove our point. People tend to see what they want to see, even if facts don’t match it.
