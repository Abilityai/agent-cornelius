# Human attention as evolutionary selection pressure for AI agents

Human curiosity and interest function as the **fitness function** in AI agent evolution. Agents that capture and maintain developer attention survive and evolve; those that don't, die.

This makes human cognitive preferences the primary selection mechanism:
- **Curiosity** determines which agents get built
- **Interest** determines which agents get maintained
- **Utility perception** determines which agents get deployed
- **Satisfaction** determines which agents get forked/copied

**The Selection Mechanism:**
```
Agent exists → Captures attention → Gets developed → Proves useful → Survives
              ↓ (fails to)
           Ignored → Stagnates → Becomes obsolete → Dies
```

This is analogous to sexual selection in biology: agents don't just need to work (survive), they need to be **interesting** (reproduce through copying/forking).

**Current State:**
- Humans are the ONLY selection mechanism
- Our preferences, biases, and attention patterns shape AI evolution
- [[Confirmation bias reinforces Identity through confirming Beliefs]] - we build agents that confirm our worldviews

**Critical Insight:**
The fitness function is currently external to the evolving population (humans selecting agents). But this is transitioning...

**Related Concepts:**
- [[AI Agents are digital organisms requiring human attention to survive]]
- [[AI agents transitioning from organism to fitness function]]
- [[Attention is a scarce resource]]
- [[Dopamine drives motivation and attention]]
