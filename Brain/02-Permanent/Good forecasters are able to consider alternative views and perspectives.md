The trick for a good forecast is to be able to consider alternative views, [[perspective]]s. 
Example from [[poker]] provided by [[Annie Duke]] - when someone raises, most of the players assume they have a strong hand. But when they are forced to take a [[perspective]] of the other person - they are not raising if they have a great or even good hand - to not give it up.

[[Once we take a view (perspective, position, belief) we leave something out]]
[[Bad forecasters rely on Causal Thinking, Confirmation of their beliefs and overconfidence]]
[[We can hold only one point of view (perspective) in our minds at a time]]
