Book [[Noise A Flaw in Human Judgment - Kahneman]]

One day I will make a tattoo with his face on my right arm, that’s for sure. 

I’m talking about Daniel Kahneman - Professor of Psychology, behavioral economist, researcher, prolific author and a Noble prize winner in Economy. Most of you probably know him by his famous book - Thinking Fast and Slow. 

He and his co-authors (Olivier Sibony, Cass R. Sunstain) got a new book! It’s called [Noise: A flaw in human judgement](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KSC11KQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). 

I’m a bit of a decision making nerd myself. I’ve red plenty of books and some research papers on behavioral economy and decision making. I even wrong a few pieces on different mental models and biases. 

So when I started reading this book I was both excited, but also a bit skeptical - like “sure, I will read the book just because Kahneman is one of the authors, but I don’t there’s anything surprising there”. See, most of the books on behavioral economy nowadays are repeating each other - talking about the same psychological biases and mental models, just from a bit different angles. That’s what I was expecting here. 

I would not mention any of the above if I did not have “But of course I was wrong!” in my pocket. This is a brilliant book that brought up a topic that was always sort of floating around us in the air, but was not seriously discussed or dealt with. Obviously, I’m talking about Noise.

I’m not going to re-tell you the book here, the goal of this article is to give you taste of what Noise is and why it is important, so you have enough motivation to spend your hard-earned money on this wonderful, albeit a bit long, book. 

**What is Noise?** 

Simply put, Noise is an undesirable variability of judgements of the same problem. 

Now you know everything and we can call it a wrap... JK.

If you understand pictures better, here’s the one that works best for me:

A bit extended version of the definition would include the following situations:

1. Whenever a person makes a predictive or evaluative judgement about anything - it contains Noise - and more of it that we think. This means that if this person was presented with the need to make the same exact judgement, based on the same data, chances are the judgement will be very much different. This is called Pattern Noise. 
2. Whenever a group of people, who we expect to be making identical decisions are drastically different in their judgements - this is called Level Noise. 

Level and Patter Noise together create a System Noise, which is the Achilles heel of many of the organizations that make repetitive judgements of the similar cases by one or more judges. Medical Decisions, investment decisions, any kind of forecasts, staff decisions, patent decisions and many many more are susceptible to this kind of error. 

A few examples so you can understand the scale of this:

1. Noise audit of the Insurance Company revealed that while executives expect around 10% noise in underwriters judgements, the actual result is 55%. This means that if one underwriter sets the premium at $9,500, the other sets it at $16,700.
2. In the study of Noise among 200+ US judges, where they judged a series of identical cases, in the case where the average sentence was 7 years, the Mean absolute difference between two random decisions is 3.8 years! Looks more like a lottery.

Now, research confirms that Noise in the decision contributes to the overall decision error as much as statistical Bias. 

People are SO BAD at managing Noise in their judgements and making consistent decisions, that based on the research you can read about in the book, almost any kind of decision automation based on the data beats humans. This just blew my mind:

1. Models, like linear regression, trained on the outcome of the decisions and input data beat humans in all cases. This is not a surprise at all, this is just a fact. But keep reading...
2. Equally wighted models, basically average of the input data, perform worse than trained models (dah!) - but still bean humans in most cases!
3. Now the one I was really shocked about - model of you beats you! Once again - model, trained based on your judgements and predictions you make, tends to outperform you on the future decisions. As Kahneman says: “There is so much noise in judgment that a noise-free model of a judge achieves more accurate predictions than the actual judge does.”
4. But even that’s not all. In some studies, Random Linear Models outperform Humans. “Their striking finding was that any linear model, when applied consistently to all cases, was likely to outdo human judges in predicting an outcome from the same information. In one of the three samples, 77% of the ten thousand randomly weighted linear models did better than the human experts. In the other two samples, 100% of the random models outperformed the humans. Or, to put it bluntly, it proved almost impossible in that study to generate a simple model that did worse than the experts did.”

Hopefully by now you understand that this is a problem. As authors note: 

> “We depend on the quality of professional judgments, by underwriters, claims adjusters, and others. We assign each case to one expert, but we operate under the wrong assumption that another expert would produce a similar judgment.”
> 

And if you thought “Whatever, I will think about it when I deal with these organizations. May be it won’t affect me anyway.” here’s the bad news for you - individual, singular decisions are suffering from Noise as much as repetitive decisions in the organizations. It’s just much harder to measure. 

So, if you are making a judgement that will never exactly repeat, e.g. you could be deciding what are the chances of you being happily married with this partner and should you do that or not, or you are deciding if you want to make a particular individual investment. From the noise reduction perspective, you should be thinking about those decisions and repetitive decision happening once. 

Good news is that the same noise reduction methods that work for organizations would work for you as well. 

Hopefully, by now you know why Noise is a problem. In the next few articles I will explain where it comes from and how to fight it. However, I still recommend reading the book - these snippets I write are just my summaries.
