[[People find much stronger confirmations for higher levels of suffering above threshold]]

We are finding the confirmation for the things we can’t avoid much easier than for the things we can. Whatever becomes “ours” (our president, our country, our wife, our car) - we are much more inclined to adjust facts and SoP to make them look good. [[Confirmation Bias]] 

Only when we can’t change something we have we start looking for the confirmation that this is good. We also surround ourselves with people who confirm our opinions to keep it confirmed. 

[[Social Groups help find confirmations to reinforce the beliefs]]

[[Confirmation Bias reinforces Identity through confirming Beliefs]]
[[Endowment Effect - what we own is more valuable than what we don't]]
