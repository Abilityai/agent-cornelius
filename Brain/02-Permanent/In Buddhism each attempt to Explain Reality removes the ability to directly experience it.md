[[Awakening and Enlightenment are about being in the Moment, in Here and Now]]

Because of the above, the core task of Buddhism is to teach us to See the Reality the way it is. And the more we are trying to explain it with [[Language]] [[Concept]] and other tools of [[Scientific thinking]] and rationality - the less we are able to experience it directly. Which means we will stay in [[Duhkha]]

[[In Buddhism - Duhkha is the reason for all the suffering]]

[[Explanation is the way to categorize the world and it creates Duhkha]]
[[Belief is a way to deal with Uncertainty, to explain parts of the world that we can't explain]]
