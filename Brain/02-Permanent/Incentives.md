# Incentives

Basic formula

If you do this → you will get that

So, incentive is a system based on the exchange of something a person has (work, asset, time, attention) to something he they want (money) with a certain level of risk and return timeframe. 

We create an optimization function with incentives. People start to optimize what we incentivize. 

The reason capitalism works is because of the incentive chains. Because companies product close to what market needs, and no more than that. Communism did not have such a balance of incentives.
