# Irreplaceable agents combine complexity, criticality, and calibration lock-in

Agents become irreplaceable when they exhibit these characteristics:

1. **Complex, multi-dimensional intelligence** - Not reducible to simple metrics (health scores, risk assessments, impact analysis)
2. **Predictive + subjective** - No immediate ground truth, requires calibration over time
3. **Embedded in critical decision flows** - Downstream agents make high-stakes decisions based on this intelligence
4. **Calibration lock-in** - Humans and agents learn to interpret the foundational agent's signals over time
5. **Non-obvious methodology** - How signals are weighted, patterns recognized, confidence calibrated is not transparent

Position agents at these intersections to maximize irreplaceability.

**The Three C Framework:**
- **Complexity:** Hard to replicate intelligence
- **Criticality:** Embedded in high-stakes decision flows
- **Calibration:** Learning over time creates switching costs

The more of these characteristics your agent exhibits, the higher the switching costs and the deeper the moat.
