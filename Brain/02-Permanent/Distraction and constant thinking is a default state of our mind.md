Our [[Default Model Network (DMN)]] is constantly running cycles of thinking caused by external and internal [[Cue]]s, often times this is related to [[Dopamine]] and [[Brain/Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]].

So unless we can see it and stop it, the default way of functioning for our [[Brain]] is to constantly be lost in the chain of thoughts.
