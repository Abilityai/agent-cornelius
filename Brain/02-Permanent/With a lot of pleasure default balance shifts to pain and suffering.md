This creates addictions. Over time our ability to experience pleasure goes down, but the pain that creates craving goes up very much. 

Example - on long-term opioid medications, body resets the balance to the side of pain and people experience new kinds and levels of pain, and can’t stop using opioids at the end. 

**So if you have a lot of pleasant activities in your life your balance shifts to pain, and by default, without doing anything you will be in pain and suffering.** 

[[Pleasure and Pain strive towards balancing each other in the brain]]
