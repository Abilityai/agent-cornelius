[[Flow is impossible without Autonomy]] 
This means that to achieve the flow you need to have resources and time to make your own decisions, enable and work with your creativity, etc. 

And the more external obligations people take - the less it becomes possible to find [[Autonomy]] and [[Flow]] as a result. 

This, in turn, limits possible achievements in life, because those are more probable with [[Flow]]

[[Flow is the most effective state of high-performers]]
[[Flow may help drive selfless states of mind]]
[[Radical ownership means owning outcomes not taking permission]] - external obligations often stem from permission-seeking rather than ownership, reducing autonomy and blocking flow
