People remember final moments of things - like movies, books or live events. We remember things at the end of the set of objects better. Example - two groups put hands in cold water for 60 seconds, and then for one of the groups the temperature is raised a bit, while others finished the experiment. The ones who had 30 more seconds of warmer water felt the whole experience was less painful. [[Memory]]
