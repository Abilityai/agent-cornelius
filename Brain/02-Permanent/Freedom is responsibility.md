[[My Thought]]

If you are limited by someone or something telling you what to do - so you are put in specific boundaries - you have a right to just rect and blame the circumstances. But if you are free to decide for yourself - you should take [[Responsibility]] for your decisions. 

If you are a CEO - you are free to decide, but you have all the responsibility. 
But if you don't like this responsibility - you might put yourself in the situation that limits your actions and takes away your [[Responsibility]]. 

This might be related to why people put themselves in situations of Existential risk for the company or for them to take [[Responsibility]] away from them. [[Existential risks in desperate situations take away decision freedom]]

[[In culture - more Choice is more Freedom, but it only creates more suffering]]
