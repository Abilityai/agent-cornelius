The Kelly criterion is the formula that determines the optimal size of the [[Bet]] in order to maximize the [[Expected Value]]. It is used in [[Gambling]] and [[Investing]].

It takes into account the probability of winning and losing, as well as the potential payouts of each bet, to determine the optimal fraction of the portfolio to allocate to each bet. The Kelly criterion is based on the idea that it is better to bet more when the odds are in your favor and less when they are not, in order to maximize the growth of your investment over time. This approach can be useful for investors who are looking to maximize their returns while also minimizing the risk of loss.

It is valid only for known outcome probabilities, which is not the case with investments. [[Risk]] averse investors should not invest the full Kelly fraction.

This formula assumes the markets are [[Non-Ergodic System]]. It makes it impossible to go bankrupt. 

Kelly fraction (Fraction of Bankroll to Allocate) = W−(1−W)/O

Where:
 - W is the probability of winning the bet
 - O is the ratio of the potential payout to the amount wagered (also known as the "Odds")

For example, 
If you invest in an early stage startup, let assume the following:
 - Probability of this startup being successful is 2%
 - If it is, you will make 100x your money (Odds)
 - According to formula - 0.02 x (100-1) / (100-0.02) = 0.0198
 - This means that you need to invest 2% of your stack in total
