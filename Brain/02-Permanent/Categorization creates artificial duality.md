Buddhism suggests that a fragmented way to see the world, split it into categories and Concepts create a fake Duality, causing us to make choices between things that don't really describe the world. 

Whenever we come up with any concept at all, we simultaneously create the opposite concept. If we take opposing concepts as Reality - they will cause [[Suffering]]. 

Good and Evil is one of the examples of this Duality
[[Once we take a view (perspective, position, belief) we leave something out]]
[[Thinking in Concepts are Categories can not fully describe the world and create Duhkha]]
[[Explanation is the way to categorize the world and it creates Duhkha]]
[[In Buddhism it is OK to conceptualize as long as we are mindful about it]]
