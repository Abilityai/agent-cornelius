Brain works in a way that it helps us find things in the world that meet our goal. But if we have multiple or constantly switching goals - it will get confused and will lose motivation to find the right things. 

Once the goals based on [[Purpose]] are defined the rest of the projects that don’t meet those goals should be ignored. This is critical for success
