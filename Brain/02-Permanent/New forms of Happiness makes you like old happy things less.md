Exploring new forms of [[happiness]] decreases the happiness level of the other happy things. For example, if you liked sunset, and then you started to only enjoy it with a cigar - sunset itself will give you much less pleasure.

This is similar to:
[[More arguments dilute the strongest ones in negotiations]]
[[Irrelevant information dilutes relevant and results in less confident judgements]]

[[Explanation of good things make us feel less happy about them]]
[[People are Happier when they select the same best option than diversity]]
