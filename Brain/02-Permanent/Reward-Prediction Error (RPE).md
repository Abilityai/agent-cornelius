Reward Prediction Error

In every behavior or a habit, including the ones related to drug, the algorithm is the same:

1. Cue (hint, trigger) that we find in the world, or run into, creates a spike of Dopamine and excitement about what this Cue is associated with 
2. Then we have a following drop of Dopamine, which creates the craving (Motivation) to get to the reward. 
3. If we get a reward, two things happen
    1. If the reward meets or exceeds our expectations - we get a bigger Dopamine spike
    2. If not - Dopamine drops well below the baseline
4. If we can’t get a reward - Dopamine drops well below the baseline
