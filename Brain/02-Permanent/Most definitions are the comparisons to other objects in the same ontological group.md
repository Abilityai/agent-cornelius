An ontological group is a collection of objects or concepts that share certain characteristics or qualities. For example, the ontological group of animals includes all living beings that are classified as animals, such as dogs, cats, and birds.

Some definitions do rely on comparisons to other objects in the same ontological group. For example, the definition of a dog might include comparisons to other animals, such as mentioning that a dog is a four-legged, carnivorous mammal.

You define things in terms of other things.
