[[My Thought]]

* The idea is that you should avoid getting into the desperate situations when you don't have a [[Choice]] but to focus all your attention on one thing. 
* This is because in this situation you lose the freedom to Choice and become unable to make rational [[Decision]]s. 
* Example - having a threat of running out of money in a [[Startup]] means that you will have to cut costs and let people go - you don't have a freedom to say no to this. 
* These situations can happen when you put all the investment into the [[Non-Ergodic System]] [[Ergodicity]]

[[Desperate situations may be a protective mechanism from uncertainty]]
[[In culture - more Choice is more Freedom, but it only creates more suffering]]
