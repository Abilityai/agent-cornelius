Beliefs we take on are the way for our [[Mind]] to deal with [[Uncertainty]]. 
We use [[Concept]]s to explain the parts of the world that we can, but for those that we can't - we rely on beliefs. Because most of the people are unable to deal with [[Uncertainty]] - they are looking for any ways to explain things in the world.
