[[Endowment Effect - what we own is more valuable than what we don't]]

If you like something or own something you overestimate the amount of people who also like or have it. 
E.g. students with iPhone think that way more people own iPhone than those who don’t. If you think something is good - player in NFL or particular laptop - you think that everyone believes the same. 

This creates inflated value for this asset which puts you in a bad position in [[Negotiation]].
