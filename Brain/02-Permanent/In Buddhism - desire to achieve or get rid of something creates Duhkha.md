Our desires, that are mostly driven by our Ego or [[Self]] are creating the state of mind that makes us  suffer. Wanting something creates an intention to get it. 

[[Desire creates a need to exert Control, and our inability to have full control creates Duhkha]]

[[In Buddhism - Duhkha is the reason for all the suffering]]
