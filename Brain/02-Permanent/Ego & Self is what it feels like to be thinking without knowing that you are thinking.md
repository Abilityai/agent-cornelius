Ego & Self is what it feels like to be thinking without knowing that you are thinking

Self is a feeling of being a thinker. The sense of being an owner of the experiences. 

Thoughts on their own are OK, but our inability to identify them as changing states of mind is what creates suffering

[[People perceive Self as a static notion within us, separate from the outside world]]
