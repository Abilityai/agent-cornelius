One of the signs of [[Depression]] is that people don’t expect any to get any [[pleasure]] from the things ahead. People can’t imagine [[future]] good feelings if they don’t feel good in the [[present]].

So when we are trying to imagine how good something is going to be when we feel bad at the moment - this is close to impossible and brings only negative feelings about the [[future]].
