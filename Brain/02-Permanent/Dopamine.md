Dopamine is a neuro-transmitter. It is in the core of making decisions and of being motivated. It dictates the level of motivation, desire and willingness to go through effort. 

It directs us to look for, want and strive for things outside ourselves. It forces us to look for novelty. Dopamine is the way we track our success and happiness in life. 

Neuro-transmitter Dopamine influences multiple neurons at the same time. It is shifting the mindset, mood etc. 

Body uses dopamine - it is trying to keep the baseline level of dopamine, but sometimes it has peaks of dopamine. 

**When you experience or crave something very pleasurable, you have a spike to Dopamine, what happens after that is that the baselines of dopamine drops.** Tonic and phasic release of dopamine. 

it is not just responsible for pleasure, but also for motivation, drive, mood and craving. It also controls time perception. It is also very important for movement.

Drug usage (cocaine, met) depletes one of the neural pathways for dopamine. Same pathway as for reward, motivation and craving. 

Release of dopamine can be volumetric (affects the baseline) and localized ( affects peaks). 

**The pleasure is experienced not at an absolute peak level, but on the difference between peak and baseline.**

Dopamine works together with Glutamate. Neurons release them together. 

**Level of motivation under “normal” level or baseline Dopamine depends on the level of Dopamine before this moment. On previous peaks.** 

**Dopamine causes addiction through the  mechanism. When you repeatedly do something your enjoy - threshold for enjoyment goes up and up, so it is harder and harder to experience the same level of pleasure. Gradually these spikes are lower, but “pain” spikes are created that makes us want to keep doing this thing. So instead of pleasure there’s pain that forces us to do things during the addiction.**  

**Dopamine works together with [[Epinephrine (  adrenaline)  [[]]]]. Epinephrine is actually manufactured from dopamine. So level and peaks of those are correlated.** 

**What increases dopamine**

Baseline is defined by genetics and things that happened before in a matter of days.

Caffeine - 30% increase in dopamine. But regular consumption of caffeine makes you able to experience dopamine effects. 

Chocolate - 1.5x increase of the baseline dopamine 

Sex - 2x above baseline 

Nicotine - 2x increase (short lived)

Cocaine - 2.5x increase 

Amphetamine - 10x

Aderol (ADHD drug) - 10x

Exercise - 2x increase in dopamine, but it depends on if you subjectively enjoy this exercise. If you don’t like it - no increase in D. 

Cold water exposure - increases the baseline of Dopamine for several hours by 250%

In general if you like something the amount of dopamine for this behavior goes up. Especially if some gratification practice or journaling is done. 

After the peak the level of dopamine returns to Lower level than the baseline before the peak. Extent to which it goes under is proportional to the height of the peak. Eventually baseline will return to normal. 

Experiencing the same things over and over again drops the peaks levels. 

This is where the addiction comes from - when the peaks are so high, and baseline is so low, that without and activity or a drug  it is impossible to motivate oneself. 

Baseline drops because of the limited amount of synthesized dopamine that can be released. 

Peaks after peaks don’t work -  baseline goes down. 

Different activities cause spikes of dopamine. So peaks can come from a ton of activities, and the baseline of progressively dropping. 

**Optimal ways to properly enjoy dopamine peaks**

Solution - Intermittent release of dopamine. Intermittent reward schedule. Intermittent reinforcement is the way to stay in the path to something. It is how gambling works when you get wins at slot machines at random times and it keeps you playing. 

The trick is not to celebrate every win, but to make some random breaks between celebrations. 

To keep doing what you like, you have to make sure the high peaks in dopamine do not occur too often. the breaks between peaks need to be random. 

**Remove Layering** - **Try removing multiple sources of dopamine release from activities which we want to enjoy or keep enjoying.** Layering several stimulants is bad because it brings higher peaks and the drops the baseline 

[[Cocaine]]  or [[Amphetamine]] harm dopamine production for a long term. 

Healthy sustained increase in dopamine can be done by **Cold water exposure** - 5-6 Celsius. dopamine can increase 2.5x after that. In this case this is not a peak, but a sustained raise that takes 3 hours to go down. 14 Celsius in another study. 

**If you like something, and then start giving yourself a reward for this, and then take away the reward - you will stop liking the activity.** 

**Dopamine baseline will crash if you see bright light in the middle of the night.** 

**Prolactin** is the opposite side of dopamine. It is Excreted in the body after sex and make us lay down and do nothing. 

**Since the dopamine pathway includes the [[PFC]]  - we can control what gives us the reward. We should not only get enjoyment from the final goal. We can learn to enjoy the effort, the hard work and process. Without layering in different sources of dopamine to make yourself continue. We are doing it by choice and because we love it.** 

The main trick is not to spike dopamine before or after an effort - only engage it at the effort. 

We can make ourselves feel pleasure from what we decide are good for us, because [[PFC]]  is connector to Dopamine pathways. 

**Research suggests that hearing something that confirms our beliefs invokes the spike in Dopamine. [[Confirmation Bias]]** 

Us vs Them confirmations also provide spike in dopamine. 

Dopamine is shaping what we see, perceive as reward. If it makes you feel good - dopamine will push you to keep doing it even if this is harmful for you. 

[[Oxytocin]] is stimulating Dopamine pathway. It is created from social connections. 

If you get less domaine than you expected from something - it’s a let down. If you get more - a pleasant surprise. 

**Drugs that impact Dopamine**

**Macuna Pruriens** - a bean that contain L-DOPA - precursor to Dopamine. It will lead to increase and the Crash in Dopamine. 

**l-thyroxin** - amino-acid precursor to dopamine. 30-40m effects. It will lead to increase and the Crash in Dopamine. 

**PEA (Phenethylamine)** - increases levels of dopamine. 30-45 minutes lasting effect. More regulated than the ones above. 

**Huperzine-A** - increases levels of Dopamine

**Aderol, Modafilin** - significantly increasing the levels of Dopamine

**Melatonin** - might give a drop in Dopamine

How to make yourself enjoy the struggle instead of the goal. 

When the dopamine is released it increases plasticity of the brain. This means that at the moments of high dopamine peak, pleasure, we can remember the struggle and appreciate it - it will teach the brain to enjoy it. 

another way is to give away the gold medal, or whatever was made during the struggle. 

I tend to get too much dopamine from telling about what I’m going to do and being certain that I can, that I don’t actually do that after that.

Laughing on oneself, being light is great. We enjoy being around people who are light, fully and make fun of us. We should do it to ourselves as well. 

Perfection should never be a goal. It is impossible and leads to depression.

[[Serotonin]]  can be achieved through journaling, gratitude, meditation, social connections and mental rest - it recovers our system and gives us the balance

when serotonin is low - people are agitated and aggressive. Irritable. 

She high -lower levels of aggression. When it’s really high - people stop pursuing goals at all. 

Tolerance to the drug is developed through the decrease of sensitivity of the neurons to Dopamine, so more and more of it are needed to stimulate it.
