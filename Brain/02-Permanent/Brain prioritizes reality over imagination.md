[[Brain]] prioritizes reality over [[imagination]]. We can’t imagine green lights when looking at the red one. We can’t feel 2 things at the same time. If we look at the ostrich, we can’t imagine this is a penguin. The same thing happens with emotions - we can’t imagine what we will feel, when we are already feeling something (and we always are).

[[When imagining the future, people think they would feel the same about situation as now]]
