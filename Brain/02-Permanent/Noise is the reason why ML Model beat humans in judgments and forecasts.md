Research shows that machine learning models beat humans in in the quality of predictions and judgments because of the Noise that people introduce. 

1. Model-based on the outcomes beats human almost always. “A 2000 review of 136 studies confirmed unambiguously that mechanical aggregation outperforms clinical judgment. The research surveyed in the article covered a wide variety of topics, including diagnosis of jaundice, fitness for military service, and marital satisfaction. Mechanical prediction was more accurate in 63 of the studies, a statistical tie was declared for another 65, and clinical prediction won the contest in 8 cases.”
2. Equally-weighted regression models (basically an average) is a bit worse than trained linear models, but still outperform humans!
3. Model of you beats you! “There is so much noise in judgment that a noise-free model of a judge achieves more accurate predictions than the actual judge does.”
4. In some studies, Random Linear Models outperform Humans. “Their striking finding was that any linear model, when applied consistently to all cases, was likely to outdo human judges in predicting an outcome from the same information. In one of the three samples, 77% of the ten thousand randomly weighted linear models did better than the human experts. In the other two samples, 100% of the random models outperformed the humans. Or, to put it bluntly, it proved almost impossible in that study to generate a simple model that did worse than the experts did.”
