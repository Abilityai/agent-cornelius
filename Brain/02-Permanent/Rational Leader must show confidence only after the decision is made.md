Common knowledges is that a [[Leader]] must have [[Confidence]] and decisiveness. Leaders must deliver a [[Vision]]. This is against all the rules of [[Forecast]]ing. So what is required in the role of [[Leader]] may undermine the role of rational thinker. 

But it is not the case. [[Confidence]] should be showed when the decision is made. 

During the decision-making, leader should be displaying (and using) humility and doubt to come close to a good decision. 
When the decision is made, to keep the morale high, a leader needs to show confidence. 

But there's a possibility that the plan can be abandoned and replaced.
