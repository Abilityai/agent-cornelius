[[Direct Comparison makes us pay attention to previously unimportant facts]]

[[Value]] is determined by the [[comparison]] of one thing to another. When we compare things, we use multitude of metrics and factors to compare. But to make the right choice about the future, we need to make a choice based on the factors that we will worry about in the future, and not the ones we worry about now. 

So, when we make a [[Choice]] based on [[comparison]] NOW, but then this comparison won’t matter, the pleasure from it quickly disappears. 

Define [[Comparison]] criteria before comparison. For the best [[Choice]] we need to first identify the list of criteria, and then use them to compare, rather than come up with the criteria as we go.
