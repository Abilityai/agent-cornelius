# Objective Ignorance
Book [[Noise A Flaw in Human Judgment - Kahneman]]

Why do we always complain about weather forecasters? Market predictions? Why medical decisions, even made by highly intelligent machines are often wrong? 

People trust algorithm more than they trust people in predictive decisions. However they are ready to listen until the first mistake only, while they keep trusting people for much longer. 

People stop believing algorithms once they make one mistake, but keep believing humans. 

So pure algorithms can only replace humans if they are near-perfect, but they can’t be. 

The reason they will never replace humans in full is called **Objective Ignorance** - all the unknowns and factors of uncertainty that we have no idea about, but that have direct influence on the results of the prediction. 

Models are better but not too much and this is because of the same Objective ignorance or the dark data - realistically missing or unpredictable information. This is basically because any model is the approximation based on the known variable, and every one of them is incomplete. 

Whenever there’s causality - there’s correlation. If follows that where there’s causality - we should be able to predict. And correlation, the accuracy of this prediction, is a measure of how much causality we understand. Hence - the correlation is a realistic measure of understanding the subject. Objective Ignorance sets the ceiling on our understanding. 

We all seem to underestimate our Objective Ignorance of the world.
