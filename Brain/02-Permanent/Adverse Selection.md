In [[economics]], insurance, and [[risk]] management, adverse selection is a [[market]] situation where buyers and sellers have different [[information]]. The result is that participants with key information might participate selectively in trades at the expense of other parties who do not have the same information.

This is a result of asymmetric [[information]], where parties are acting in their interest, which results in the collapse of the markets. Example - cal dealerships, that stop selling good card, because buyers are only ready to pay an average price, because they can't tell the difference between good card and bad.
