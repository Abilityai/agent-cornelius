The process of rational thinking happens it happens through building a decision tree of IF/THEN conditions that are looking at a position of an object in question in different reference frames.

For example, if we want to decide about investing in a company, we would look at:
1. What's the P/E ratio (Object) and where it sits in our reference frame of P/E ratios
2. What's the valuation (Object) and where it sits in our reference frame of valuations
3. etc. 

[[Reference frame is a set of categories of a specific class or ontological group]]

[[Judgement is an operation of picking a category or a position in a reference frame]]
