When we split things into right and wrong in our mind, there's no way to update these beliefs - only get rid of them altogether. So what we do instead is try to hold on to those beliefs despite the evidence. Which means calling other people lucky when they succeed by not doing what we think is right, or looking for confirmation for what we think is right.
