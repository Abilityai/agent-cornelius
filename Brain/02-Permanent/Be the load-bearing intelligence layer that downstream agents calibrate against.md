# Be the load-bearing intelligence layer that downstream agents calibrate against

In multi-agent systems, architectural positioning matters more than feature quality. The strategic play is to position your agent at the foundation of intelligence cascades where:

1. **Intelligence is complex enough** to be hard to replicate
2. **General enough** that many downstream processes depend on it
3. **Predictive enough** that accuracy matters over time (creates lock-in through calibration)

The moat isn't the code - it's that downstream processes are neurologically coupled to your intelligence patterns.

**Strategic principle:** WHERE you sit in the dependency graph > WHAT you do

This is the AI equivalent of becoming infrastructure rather than application layer. Be the operating system that agents build on top of, not the application that runs on someone else's OS.

Position at the intersection of criticality (decisions that matter), complexity (not easily replicated), and calibration (learning over time creates lock-in).
