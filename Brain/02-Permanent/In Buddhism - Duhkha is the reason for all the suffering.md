Duhkha has multiple sources, but in a nutshell [[Duhkha]] is a state of mind when we want something, run from something, unhappy about something, afraid. It seems to be connected to constant chains of [[Dopamine]] and [[Brain/Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]] mechanism. 

There are different kinds of [[Duhkha]]
	Duhkha of Pain. Both physical and mental. We can only deal with pain by facing it directly. 
	Duhkha of Change. Everything around us changes all the time and it gives us discomfort. 
	Duhkha of Being. Existential pain. Realization we are going to die. Uncertainty about what happens after death.
