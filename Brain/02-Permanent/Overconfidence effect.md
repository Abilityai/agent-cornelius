# Overconfidence effect

Overconfidence is a tendency to be way more convinced in your own knowledge than the reality is. Because of it we don’t see Black Swans and in general ignore the information that is absent. 

The overconfidence effect is observed when people’s subjective confidence in their own ability is greater than their objective (actual) performance (Pallier et al., 2002). It is frequently measured by having experimental participants answer general knowledge test questions. They are then asked to rate how confident they are in their answers on a scale. Overconfidence is measured by calculating the score for a person’s average confidence rating relative to the actual proportion of questions answered correctly.
