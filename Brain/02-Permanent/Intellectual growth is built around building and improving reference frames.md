The whole reason to read books and learn something is to develop new reference frames and beliefs about the world as a position in this reference frames. And by that - creating a "better" model of the world. 

[[All models are wrong, but some are useful]]
[[Brain stores information in a set of reference frames]]
[[Reference frame is a set of categories of a specific class or ontological group]]
[[Thinking is building decision trees based on position of objects in a reference frame]]
[[Confirmation Bias reinforces Identity through confirming Beliefs]]
