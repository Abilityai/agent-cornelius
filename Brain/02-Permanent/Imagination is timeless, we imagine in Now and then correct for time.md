**When we imagine how we would feel at an event, we are trying to imagine how we would feel if this event occurred now, and then making corrections for time.** 

Because this is the mechanism that we have, we suffer from sort of [[Anchoring bias]], because we can’t “correct” our imagination in time far enough. **Our result will be very close to the what we think we would feel now. So, the further the [[prediction]] of how we feel goes, the less precise it is.** 
When people are distracted by something when they are making this [[judgement]] - they are “correcting” much less, so making a bigger mistake.
