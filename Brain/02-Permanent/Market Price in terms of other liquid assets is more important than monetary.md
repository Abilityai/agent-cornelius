[[Stock Market]] [[Investing]] [[Money]] [[Credit]]

If the assed is liquid - it’s [[price]] is defined by the supply-demand for the exchange of a small amount of this asses between [[market]] players.

If the [[asset]] is illiquid - the price is defined by the estimate based on the other prices for similar items.

Both are basically estimates and not “real” prices.

Cash is the means of exchange for going from one asset class to another. So it serves the function of defining the exchange rate.

So, the asset value in this case only matters if you plan to exchange it for Cash and use for another asset. So not the cash matters, but rather relative exchange rate between the asset you have and the asset you want.

If the market is going down, many items can go down together, and their relative price won’t necessarily drop. So if you look at the market investment as a long term investment and you don’t have a plan to pull the [[money]] to exchange them for another asset soon - then the relative prices for another asset class does not matter, but what matters is a relative price within the asset class.
