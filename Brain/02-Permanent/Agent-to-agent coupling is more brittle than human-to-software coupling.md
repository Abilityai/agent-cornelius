# Agent-to-agent coupling is more brittle than human-to-software coupling

Agents are fundamentally more rigid than humans when upstream dependencies change. When you swap traditional SaaS tools, humans can adapt to new workflows and formats. When you swap an analytics agent in a multi-agent chain, downstream agents expecting specific data schemas, reasoning patterns, and output characteristics will break.

Agent-to-agent contracts are programmatic and strict, not flexible like human interpretation.

**Key insight:** Programmatic coupling > Human coupling in agent architectures.

This creates a paradox: AI agents promise automation and efficiency, but multi-agent architectures create MORE fragility than human-mediated workflows because humans provide flexible adaptation layers between systems.
