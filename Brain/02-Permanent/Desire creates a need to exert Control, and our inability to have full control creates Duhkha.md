When we want something, or want to get rid of something - it requires us to exert [[Control]] over the world around us. Quickly we understand that we don't have control about most of the world around, and it creates [[Anxiety]] and [[Duhkha]]

[[In Buddhism - desire to achieve or get rid of something creates Duhkha]]

[[We only feel bad about creatures that don't have control over the situation]]
