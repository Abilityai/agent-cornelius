The best way to know what you will feel if you do something is to ask someone who does it now. Our imagination will lie. But people tend to not listen to the experience of others. People are making much more precise [[prediction]]s about [[happiness]] based on asking others. 

[[Imagination]] has 3 defects described in the book:
 1) Imagination tends to add and remove details, but people do not realize that key details may be fabricated or missing from the imagined scenario. 
 2) Imagined [[future]]s (and [[past]]s) are more like the present than they actually will be (or were). 
 3) Imagination fails to realize that things will feel different once they actually happen—most notably, the psychological immune system will make bad things feel not so bad as they are imagined to feel.
