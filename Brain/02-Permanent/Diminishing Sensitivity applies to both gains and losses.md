Gains and Losses are both relatives to the volume of gains and losses before. Gaining of losing $10 instead of $20 feels much worse than gaining or losing $110 instead of $120. 

If you look at the perspective of time - then [[Temporal discounting]] works in a similar way - the more time passes the less value is seen.
