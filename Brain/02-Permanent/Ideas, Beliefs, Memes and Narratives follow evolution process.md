People tend to spread their ideas, beliefs, memes and narratives, and those survive and develop using the same principles of evolution and selection. 

[[Almost every communication is an attempt to influence beliefs]]

These people are performing an evolution of [[meme]]s, or [[belief]]s. And according to the evolution, the ones that are progressing to the future generations are the ones that help the "agent" live longer. Genes are passed when holder of genes survive.

[[Early social signals define the success of an idea spread]]
[[Social Media optimize for attention and engagement]]
[[People interpret information from social media as consensus view]]

**Digital Evolution Parallel:**
- [[AI agents transitioning from organism to fitness function]] - Same evolutionary principles apply to AI agents
- [[GitHub as evolutionary substrate for AI agents]] - Digital platform for variation, selection, reproduction
- [[Human attention as evolutionary selection pressure for AI agents]] - Attention as fitness function for digital replicators
- [[Attention as Universal Selection Pressure - From Media to AI]] - Universal mechanism across memes and AI agents
