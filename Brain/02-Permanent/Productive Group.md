This is a group or [[Team]] focused on creating the most effective [[Decision Making]], identifying [[Bias]]es and helping team members to [[Learning]] and Improve better. 

The idea is that it's much easier to detect [[bias]]es in others then in yourself. And you need to be open to [[Feedback]] from other members. 

You need to disconnect your [[Ego]] from the quality of the decisions you make. 

You need to be able to engage in [[Constructive Conflict]]. 

These groups need to promote [[Psychological safety]] for people to not be afraid to share what they really think. 

Don’t share the [[outcome]] when discussing the decision with a [[Productive Group]].
