Barbell investing is a strategy that involves investing in a mix of very safe and very risky investments. The idea behind this approach is to minimize the overall risk of an investment portfolio by balancing the potential rewards and risks of different types of investments. With a barbell strategy, investors might allocate a significant portion of their portfolio to very safe investments, such as Treasury bonds, while also investing in riskier assets, such as stocks or real estate, that have the potential for higher returns. This strategy can help investors to protect their capital while still giving them exposure to potentially lucrative opportunities.

The barbell investing strategy is commonly used for fixed-income investing, but can also be used in equity markets.
