What is currently ours has a lot more value for us than something that is not. Even if before that something did not have any value for us. 

Example:
Two groups were given either a Mug or a Lottery ticket. And then both groups received an offer to exchange one for another. Basically both were asked the same question - would you rather have a Mug or a Lottery ticket. At the end around 70-80% of people decided to keep what they had instead of making a trade.
