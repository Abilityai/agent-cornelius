[[Social Media]] uses the same approach as [[Gambling]] to keep people posting to it. Every we post it is a random chance in terms of how many likes and comments and attention this post would get, which is a definition of [[Intermittent Variable Reinforcement (IVR)]]. That's why people want to come back to posting even if their posts don't take off.
