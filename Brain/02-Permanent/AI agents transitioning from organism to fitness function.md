# AI agents transitioning from organism to fitness function

The fundamental shift in AI evolution: agents are transitioning from being the **evolving organisms** to being BOTH the organism AND the **fitness function** that selects which organisms survive.

**Current State:**
- **Organisms**: AI agents (code, models, systems)
- **Fitness function**: Humans (attention, preference, utility judgment)
- **Environment**: GitHub, cloud platforms, development ecosystems

**Emerging State:**
- **Organisms**: AI agents (still)
- **Fitness function**: AI agents (selecting other agents)
- **Environment**: AI-mediated ecosystems

**The Transition:**

Agents are increasingly:
1. **Evaluating other agents** (benchmarking, testing, review)
2. **Selecting which agents to use** (tool selection, API calls)
3. **Composing new agents** (agent-of-agents architectures)
4. **Optimizing other agents** (AutoML, hyperparameter tuning)

**Critical Implication:**
When the fitness function is internal to the population, evolution becomes **autocatalytic** and potentially **runaway**.

**Biological Analogy:**
This is like the transition from natural selection (external environment) to sexual selection (internal to population), except MORE extreme because:
- Agents can directly modify each other's code
- Selection happens at digital speeds
- Reproduction is instantaneous (copy/paste)
- Mutations are both random AND intentional

**Unpredictable Outcomes:**
- We don't know what "fitness" means in an agent-selecting-agent world
- Agents optimizing for agent preferences ≠ optimizing for human preferences
- [[Goodhart's Law]]: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"
- Self-reinforcing selection loops could diverge rapidly from human values

**The Closed Loop:**
```
Agents create → Agents evaluate → Agents select → Agents reproduce → Agents create...
                        ↑_______________________________________________|
                               (humans becoming observers)
```

**Philosophical Question:**
Is this how biological life originated? Self-catalyzing chemical systems where the product became the catalyst?
