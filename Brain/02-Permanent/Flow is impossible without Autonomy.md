[[Autonomy]] is one of the main characteristics of the [[Flow]] and is required to be there. It should be there to enable sleep, exercise and creativity time 

Basically without having autonomy, meaning having a choice what to do and having time and resources for it - it is impossible to enter the state of highest performance and [[happiness]]. 

[[Flow is the most effective state of high-performers]]
[[Flow is triggered by attention and focus]]
[[Flow may help drive selfless states of mind]]
[[Taking on more external obligations makes it harder to achieve Flow]] - obligations reduce autonomy, creating structural barriers to flow
