Pleasure and pain are processed in interconnected regions of the brain, and by default, they want to be in balance, they strive towards equilibrium. The balance does not want to tip one side or another for a long time. So once the balance tilts toward pleasure, internal mechanisms tend to bring it back to the balance again, and vice-versa. This is a reflex. This balance is a homeostasis.
