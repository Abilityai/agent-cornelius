Our habits are created by the chain of Cue -> Routine -> Reward. This whole cycle is stimulated by [[Dopamine]] and [[Brain/Reward-Prediction Error (RPE)]]. 
In order to change it we need to rely on the same queue, but replace a Routine. For example, once we see a can of coke, this is a cue, we need to recognize it and act differently. Over time we will get the reward.
