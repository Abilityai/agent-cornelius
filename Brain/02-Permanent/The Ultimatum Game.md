[[Misbehaving - Richard Thaler]] [[Fairness]] [[Money]] [[Game Theory]]

Described game is when there’s a Proposer and Responder. Proposer has X (e.g. $10) money and they may offer any amount to Responder. If they accept - both get their money. If not - nobody gets paid. 

Rational way to play this for Proposer would be to offer the minimal amount, and for Responder to accept it. 

In reality the offers under 20% of the amount were rejected. 

Optimal offer is about 40% - highest changes to get accepted. 

Results are similar across the world. 

Results are also similar when the stakes are high.
