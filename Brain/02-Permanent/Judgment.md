Book [[Noise A Flaw in Human Judgment - Kahneman]]
I hope you had a chance to read my previous article on Noise. If you did not - you should definitely go back and do that to have more context, however this article will make sense on its own. 

I want to pick one specific example from the book (ref: Noise - Flaw...). 

This is a bit of a practical exercise and you will enjoy it if you try to do it as I ask. 

Say you need to assess the probability that the following candidate will be successful after two years on the job. Successful is defined simply as the candidate’s having kept the CEO job at the end of the two years. Express the probability on a scale from 0 (impossible) to 100 (certain).

> Michael Gambardi is thirty-seven years old. He has held several positions since he graduated from Harvard Business School twelve years ago. Early on, he was a founder and an investor in two start-ups that failed without attracting much financial support. He then joined a large insurance company and quickly rose to the position of regional chief operating officer for Europe. In that post, he initiated and managed an important improvement in the timely resolution of claims. He was described by colleagues and subordinates as effective but also as domineering and abrasive, and there was a significant turnover of executives during his tenure. Colleagues and subordinates also attest to his integrity and willingness to take responsibility for failures. For the last two years, he has served as CEO of a medium-sized financial company that was initially at risk of failing. He stabilized the company, where he is considered successful though difficult to work with. He has indicated an interest in moving on. Human resources specialists who interviewed him a few years ago gave him superior grades for creativity and energy but also described him as arrogant and sometimes tyrannical.
What is the probability that Michael, if hired, will still be in his job after two years?

Done? Have you landed on the number? Cool. 

Now let me describe what just happened in your head. 

1. Of all the cues provided by the description (which are only a subset of what you might need to know), you attended to some more than others without being fully aware of the choices you made.
2. Then, you informally integrated these cues into an overall impression of Gambardi’s prospects. Informally and without realizing it, you created a Model of Michael.
3. You converted this impression into the number on a scale from 0 to 100. This is a Matching operation. Why specifically the number you chose? It’s unclear, most likely it just came to your mind, and you felt like the model of Michael was coherent with this number (and vice-versa).
4. You received an Internal **Signal of Judgement Completion** - your answer feels right. And it feels good!

Each of the steps entails variability and creates noise, as a result, when done among 115 MBA students the results were anywhere between 10% and 95%.

Each of the steps you took in making the judgement is prone to judgement error on its own.

While you think you were looking for the right answer, the real aim of your judgement was finding Coherent solution and achieving Internal Signal of Judgement Completion. And it feels good, it gives you satisfaction. 

Do you realize that a good portion of your everyday judgements and predictions are like that? And that you repeat the same process over and over again? Don’t be surprised it does not always give you the best results.

To wrap it up, I could not find anything better but to quote Daniel Kahneman:

> “What people usually claim to strive for in verifiable judgments is a prediction that matches the outcome. What they are effectively trying to achieve, regardless of verifiability, is the internal signal of completion provided by the coherence between the facts of the case and the judgment. And what they should be trying to achieve, normatively speaking, is the judgment process that would produce the best judgment over an ensemble of similar cases.”

How judgement happens:

1. We shape our beliefs about any topics in a form of Reference Frames. Those contain where in relation to other objects of the same category this object is, and where the limits of this category. 
2. We tend to confirm our beliefs and reinforces them, so we basically confirm our reference frames. 
3. When we need to make a judgement, we take into account only facts that we have reference frames about and make a judgment based on that. 
4. We then search for the Integral signal of completion to know what we completed the judgement.
