[[Creativity]] is controlled by the same mechanism as impulse control ([[PFC]])- this means the more impulse control people have the less creative they tend to be, unless trained for Creativity. Older people have more impulse control - and because of this they are less creative. 

Children are the most creative, and over time people become less and less creative.
