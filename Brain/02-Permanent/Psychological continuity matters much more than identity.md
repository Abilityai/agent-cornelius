[[Identity]] doesn’t matter. We should only care about psychological continuity.

If we think about the teleportation experiment when one copy of us is destroyed and identical copy is created - the resulting copy will have all the same identity as a previous one, but it will not continuity the way previous version had. 
We can look at the reality as a version of this teleportation, where every moment we are destroyed and re-created. And what matters is this feeling of continuity, rather than the identity we associate with.
